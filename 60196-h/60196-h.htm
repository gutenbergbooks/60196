<h3>
PREFACE
</h3>

<p>
These tales are memories of several months
spent as a special correspondent attached
to the forces of the American Navy on
foreign service.  Many of the little stories
are personal experiences, though some are
"written up" from the records and others
set down after interviews.  In writing them,
I have not sought the laurels of an official
historian, but been content to chronicle the
interesting incidents of the daily life as well
as the achievements and heroisms of the
friends who keep the highways of the sea.
</p>

<p>
To my hosts of the United States Navy
one and all, I am under deep obligation for
the courtesy and hospitality everywhere
extended to me on my visit.  But surely the
greatest of my obligations is that owed to
Secretary Daniels for the personal permission
which made possible my journey? and for the
good will with which he saw me on my way.
And no acknowledgment, no matter how
studied or courtly its phrasing, can express
what I owe to Admiral Sims for the friendliness
of my reception, for his care that I be shown
all the Navy's activities, and for his constant
and kindly effort to advance my work in
every possible way.  To Admiral Hugh
Rodman of the battleship squadron, his sometime
guest here renders thanks for the opportunity
given him to spend some ten days aboard
the American flagship and for the welcome
which makes his stay aboard so pleasant a
memory.
</p>

<p>
To the following officers, also, am I much
indebted: Captain, now Admiral Hughes,
Captain J. R. Poinsett Pringle, Chief of Staff
at the Irish Base, Captain Thomas Hart,
Chief of Staff directing submarine operations,
Commander Babcock and Commander
Daniels, both of Admiral Sims' staff,
Commander Bryant and Commander Carpender,
both of Captain Pringle's staff, Commander
Henry W. Cooke and Commander Wilson
Brown, both of the destroyer flotilla, Lieutenant
Horace H. Jalbert of the U.S.S. Bushnell,
Lieutenant Commander Morton L. Deyo,
Chaplain J. L. Neff, Lieutenant F. H. King,
Lieutenant Lanman, Lieutenant Herrick,
and Lieutenant Lewis Hancock, Lieutenant
George Hood and Lieutenant Bumpus
of our submarines.
</p>

<p>
I would not end without a word of thanks
to the enlisted men for their unfailing good
will and ever courteous behaviour.
</p>

<p>
To Mr. Ellery Sedgwick of the <i>Atlantic
Monthly</i>, under whose colours I had the
honour to make my journalistic cruise, I
am indebted for more friendly help, counsel
and encouragement than I shall ever be able
to repay.  And I shall not easily forget the
kindly offices and unfailing hospitality of
Captain Luke C. Doyle of Washington, D.C.,
and Mr. Sidney A. Mitchell of the London
Committee of the United States Food Administration.

<h3>
I
<br /><br />
AN HEROIC JOURNEY
</h3>

<p>
A London day of soft and smoky skies
darkened every now and then by capricious
and intrusive little showers was
drawing to a close in a twilight of gold and
grey.  Our table stood in a bay of plate glass
windows over-looking the embankment close
by Cleopatra's needle; we watched the little,
double-decked tram cars gliding by, the
opposing, interthreading streams of pedestrians,
and a fleet of coal barges coming up
the river solemn as a cloud.  Behind us lay,
splendid and somewhat theatric, the mottled
marble, stiff, white napery, and bright silver
of a fashionable dining hall.  Only a few
guests were at hand.  At our little table sat
the captain of a submarine who was then in
London for a few days on richly merited leave,
a distinguished young officer of the "mother
ship" accompanying our under water craft,
and myself.  It is impossible to be long with
submarine folk without realizing that they
are a people apart, differing from the rest of
the Naval personnel even as their vessels differ.
A man must have something individual to
his character to volunteer for the service,
and every officer is a volunteer.  An
extraordinary power of quick decision, a certain
keen, resolute look, a certain carriage;
submarine folk are such men as all of us pray to
have by our side in any great trial or crisis
of our life.
</p>

<p>
Guests began to come by twos and threes,
girls in pretty shimmering dresses, young army
officers with wound stripes and clumsy limps; a
faint murmur of conversation rose, faint and
continuous as the murmur of a distant stream.
</p>

<p>
Because I requested him, the captain told
me of the crossing of the submarines.  It
was the epic of an heroic journey.
</p>

<p>
"After each boat had been examined in
detail, we began to fill them with supplies for
the voyage.  The crew spent days manoeuvring
cases of condensed milk, cans of butter,
meat, and chocolate down the hatchways,
food which the boat swallowed up as if she
had been a kind of steel stomach.  Until we
had it all neatly and tightly stowed away,
the Z looked like a corner grocery store.
Then early one December morning we pulled
out of the harbour.  It wasn't very cold, merely
raw and damp, and it was misty dark.  I
remember looking at the winter stars riding
high just over the meridian.  The port behind
us was still and dead, but a handful of navy
folk had come to one of the wharves to see
us off.  Yes, there was something of a stir,
you know the kind of stir that's made when
boats go to sea, shouted orders, the splash of
dropped cables, vagrant noises.  It didn't
take a great time to get under way; we were
ready, waiting for the word to go.  The flotilla,
mother-ship, tugs and all, was out to sea long
before the dawn.  You would have liked the
picture, the immense stretch of the greyish,
winter-stricken sea, the little covey of
submarines running awash, the grey mother-ship
going ahead casually as an excursion steamer
into the featureless dawn.  The weather was
wonderful for two days, a touch of Indian
summer on December's ocean, then on the
night of the third day we ran into a blow,
the worst I ever saw in my life.  A storm....
Oh boy!"
</p>

<p>
He paused for an instant to flick the ashes
from his cigarette with a neat, deliberate
gesture.  One could see memories living in
the fine, resolute eyes.  The broken noises
of the restaurant which had seemingly died
away while he spoke crept back again to one's
ears.  A waiter dropped a clanging fork.
</p>

<p>
"A storm.  Never remember anything like
it.  A perfect terror.  Everybody realized that
any attempt to keep together would be
hopeless.  And night was coming on.  One
by one the submarines disappeared into that
fury of wind and driving water; the mothership,
because she was the largest vessel in the
flotilla, being the last we saw.  We snatched
her last signal out of the teeth of the gale,
and then she was gone, swallowed up in the
storm.  So we were alone.
</p>

<p>
We got through the night somehow or other.
The next morning the ocean was a dirty
brown-grey, and knots and wisps of cloud
were tearing by close over the water.  Every
once in a while a great, hollow-bellied wave
would come rolling out of the hullaballoo and
break thundering over us.  On all the boats
the lookout on the bridge had to be lashed in
place, and every once in a while a couple of
tons of water would come tumbling past
him.  Nobody at the job stayed dry for more
than three minutes; a bathing suit would
have been more to the point than oilers.
Shaken, you ask?  No, not very bad, a few
assorted bruises and a wrenched thumb,
though poor Jonesie on the Z3 had a wave
knock him up against the rail and smash in
a couple of ribs.  But no being sick for him,
he kept to his feet and carried on in spite of
the pain, in spite of being in a boat which
registered a roll of seventy degrees.  I used
to watch the old hooker rolling under me.
You've never been on a submarine when she's
rolling&mdash;talk about rolling&mdash;oh boy!  We
all say seventy degrees because that's as far
as our instruments register.  There were times
when I almost thought she was on her way
to make a complete revolution.  You can
imagine what it was like inside.  To begin
with, the oily air was none too sweet, because
every time we opened a hatch we shipped
enough water to make the old hooker look
like a start at a swimming tank, and then
she was lurching so continuously and violently
that to move six feet was an expedition.
But the men were wonderful, wonderful!
Each man at his allotted task, and&mdash;what's
that English word, ... carrying on.  Our
little cook couldn't do a thing with the stove,
might as well have tried to cook on a miniature
earthquake, but he saw that all of us had
something to eat, doing his bit, game as
could be."
</p>

<p>
He paused again.  The embankment was
fading in the dark.  A waiter appeared, and
drew down the thick, light-proof curtains.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, the men were wonderful&mdash;wonderful.
And there wasn't very much sickness.  Let's
see, how far had I got&mdash;since it was impossible
to make any headway we lay to for forty-eight
hours.  The deck began to go the second
morning, some of the plates being ripped
right off.  And blow&mdash;well as I told you in
the beginning, I never saw anything like
it.  The disk of the sea was just one great,
ragged mass of foam all being hurled through
space by a wind screaming by with the voice
and force of a million express trains.  Perhaps
you are wondering why we didn't submerge.
Simply couldn't use up our electricity.  It
takes oil running on the surface to create the
electric power, and we had a long, long
journey ahead.  Then ice began to form on
the superstructure, and we had to get out
a crew to chop it off.  It was something of a
job; there wasn't much to hang on to, and
the waves were still breaking over us.  But
we freed her of the danger, and she went on.
</p>

<p>
We used to wonder where the other boys
were in the midst of all the racket.  One was
drifting towards the New England coast,
her compass smashed to flinders; others had
run for Bermuda, others were still at sea.
</p>

<p>
Then we had three days of good easterly
wind.  By jingo, but the good weather was
great, were we glad to have it&mdash;oh boy!
We had just got things ship-shape again when
we had another blow but this second one was
by no means as bad as the first.  And after
that we had another spell of decent weather.
The crew used to start the phonograph and
keep it going all day long.
</p>

<p>
The weather was so good that I decided
to keep right on to the harbour which was
to be our base over here.  I had enough oil,
plenty of water, the only possible danger
was a shortage of provisions.  So I put us all
on a ration, arranging to have the last grand
meal on Christmas day.  Can you imagine
Christmas on a little, storm-bumped
submarine some hundred miles off the coast?
A day or two more and we ran calmly into
... Shall we say deleted harbour?
</p>

<p>
Hungry, dirty, oh so dirty, we hadn't
had any sort of bath or wash for about
three weeks; we all were green looking from
having been cooped up so long, and our
unshaven, grease-streaked faces would have
upset a dinosaur.  The authorities were
wonderfully kind and looked after us and
our men in the very best style.  I thought
we could never stop eating and a real sleep,
... oh boy!
</p>

<p>
"Did you fly the flag as you came in?" I
asked.
</p>

<p>
"You bet we did!" answered the captain,
his keen, handsome face lighting at the
memory.  "You see," he continued in a practical
spirit, "they would probably have pumped
us full of holes if we hadn't."
</p>

<p>
And that is the way that the American submarines
crossed the Atlantic to do their share
for the Great Cause.

II
<br /><br />
INTO THE DARK
</h3>

<p>
I got to the Port of the Submarines just
as an uncertain and rainy afternoon had
finally decided to turn into a wild and
disagreeable night.  Short, drenching showers of
rain fell one after the other like the strokes of
a lash, a wind came up out of the sea, and one
could hear the thunder of surf on the
headlands.  The mother ship lay moored in a wild,
desolate and indescribably romantic bay;
she floated in a sheltered pool a very oasis
of modernity, a marvellous creature of another
world and another time.  There was just
light enough for me to see that her lines were
those of a giant yacht.  Then a curtain of
rain beat hissing down upon the sea, and the
ship and the vague darkening landscape
disappeared, disappeared as if it might have
melted away in the shower.  Presently the
bulk of the vessel appeared again: gliding and
tossing at once we drew alongside, and from
that moment on, I was the guest of the
vessel, recipient of a hospitality and courtesy
for which I here make grateful acknowledgment
to my friends and hosts.
</p>

<p>
The mother ship of the submarines was a
combination of flag ship, supply station,
repair shop and hotel.  The officers of the
submarines had rooms aboard her which
they occupied when off patrol, and the
crews off duty slung their hammocks 'tween
decks.  The boat was pretty well crowded,
having more submarines to look after than
she had been built to care for, but thanks
to the skill of her officers, everything was
going as smoothly as could be.  The vessel
had, so to speak, a submarine atmosphere.
Everybody aboard lived, worked and would
have died for the submarine.  They believed
in the submarine, believed in it with an
enthusiasm which rested on pillars of practical
fact.  The Chief of Staff was the youngest
captain in our Navy, a man of hard energy
and keen insight, one to whom our submarine
service owes a very genuine debt.  His officers
were specialists.  The surgeon of the vessel
had been for years engaged in studying the
hygiene of submarines, and was constantly
working to free the atmosphere of the vessels
from deleterious gases and to improve the
living conditions of the crews.  I remember
listening one night to a history of the
submarine told by one of the officers of the staff,
and for the first time in my life I came to
appreciate at its full value the heroism of
the men who risked their lives in the first
cranky, clumsy, uncertain little vessels, and
the imagination and the faith of the men
who believed in the type.  Ten years ago,
a descent in a sub was an adventure to
be prefaced by tears and making of wills;
to-day submarines are chasing submarines
hundreds of miles at sea, are crossing the
ocean, and have grown from a tube of steel
not much larger than a life boat to underwater
cruisers which carry six-inch guns.
Said an officer to me:
</p>

<p>
"The future of the submarine?  Why, sir,
the submarine is the only war vessel that's
going to have a future!"

A flock of submarines and the &quot;mother&quot; ship in harbor
</p>

<p>
On the night of my arrival, once dinner
was over, I went on deck and looked down
through the rain at the submarines moored
alongside.  They lay close by, one beside
the other, in a pool of radiance cast by a
number of electric lights hanging over each open
hatchway.  Beyond this pool lay the rain and
the dark; within it, their sides awash in the
clear green water of the bay, their grey bridges
and rust-stained superstructures shining in
the rain, lay the strange, bulging, crocodilian
shapes of steel.  There was something
unearthly, something not of this world or time
in the picture; I might have been looking
at invaders of the sleeping earth.  The wind
swept past in great booming salvoes; rain
fell in sloping, liquid rods through the
brilliancy of electric lamps burning with a
steadiness that had something in it of strange,
incomprehensible and out of place in the
motion and hullabaloo of the storm.  And then,
too, a hand appeared on the topmost rung of
the nearer ladder, and a bulky sailor, a very
human sailor in very human dungarees, poked
his head out of the aperture, surveyed the
inhospitable night, and disappeared.
</p>

<p>
"He's on Branch's boat.  They're going
out to-night," said the officer who was guiding
me about.
</p>

<p>
"To-night?  How on earth will he ever
find his way to the open sea?"
</p>

<p>
"Knows the bay like a book.  However,
if the weather gets any worse, I doubt if the
captain will let him go.  George will be wild
if they don't let him out.  Somebody has
just reported wreckage off the coast, so there
must be a Hun round."
</p>

<p>
"But are not our subs sometimes mistaken
for Germans?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes," was the calm answer.
</p>

<p>
I thought of that ominous phrase I
had noted in the British records "failed
to report," and I remembered the stolid
British captain who had said to me,
speaking of submarines, "Sometimes nobody
knows just what happened.  Out there in
the deep water, whatever happens, happens
in a hurry."  My guide and I went below
to the officers' corridor.  Now and then,
through the quiet, a mandolin or guitar
could be heard far off twanging some
sentimental island ditty, and beneath these
sweeter sounds lay a monotonous mechanical
humming.
</p>

<p>
"What's that sound?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"That's the Filipino mess boys having a
little festino in their quarters.  The humming?
Oh, that's the mother-ship's dynamos charging
the batteries of Branch's boat.  Saves
running on the surface."
</p>

<p>
My guide knocked at a door.  Within his
tidy, little room, the captain who was to
go out on patrol was packing the personal
belongings he needed on the trip.
</p>

<p>
"Hello, Jally!" he cried cheerily when he
saw us.  "Come on in.  I am only doing a
little packing up.  What's it like outside?"
</p>

<p>
"Raining same as ever, but I don't think
it's blowing up any harder."
</p>

<p>
"Hooray!" cried the young captain with
heart-felt sincerity.  "Then I'll get out
to-night.  You know the captain told me that
if it got any worse he'd hold me till to-morrow
morning.  I told him I'd rather go out
to-night.  Perfect cinch once you get to the
mouth of the bay, all you have to do is
submerge and take it easy.  What do you think
of the news?  Smithie thinks he saw a Hun
yesterday....  Got anything good to read?
Somebody's pinched that magazine I was
reading.  Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, that
ought to be enough handkerchiefs....  Hello,
there goes the juice."
</p>

<p>
The humming of the dynamo was dying
away slowly, fading with an effect of lengthening
distance.  The guitar orchestra, as if
to celebrate its deliverance, burst into a
triumphant rendering of Sousa's "Stars and
Stripes."
</p>

<p>
My guide and I waited till after midnight
to watch the going of Branch's Z5.  Branch
and his second, wearing black oilskins down
whose gleaming surface ran beaded drops
of rain, stood on the bridge; a number of
sailors were busy doing various things along
the deck.  The electric lights shone in all their
calm unearthly brilliance.  Then slowly, very
slowly, the Z5 began to gather headway,
the clear water seemed to flow past her green
sides, and she rode out of the pool of light
into the darkness waiting close at hand.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye!  Good luck!" we cried.
</p>

<p>
A vagrant shower came roaring down into
the shining pool.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye!" cried voices through the night.
</p>

<p>
Three minutes later all trace of the Z5 had
disappeared in the dark.

III
<br /><br />
FRIEND OR FOE?
</h3>

<p>
Captain Bill of the Z3 was out on
patrol.  His vessel was running
submerged.  The air within, they had
but recently dived, was new and sweet, and
that raw cold which eats into submerged
submarines had not begun to take the joy
out of life.  It was the third day out; the time,
five o'clock in the afternoon.  The outer world,
however, did not penetrate into the submarine.
Night or day, on the surface or submerged,
only one time, a kind of motionless electric
high noon existed within those concave walls
of gleaming cream white enamel.  Those of
the crew not on watch were taking it easy.
Like unto their officers, submarine sailors
are an unusual lot.  They are real sailors,
or machinist sailors, boys for whose quality
the Navy has a flattering, picturesque and
quite unprintable adjective.  A submarine
man, mind you, works harder than perhaps
any other man of his grade in the Navy,
because the vessel in which he lives is nothing
but a tremendously intricate machine.  In
one of the compartments the phonograph,
the eternal, ubiquitous phonograph of the
Navy, was bawling its raucous rags and
mechano-nasal songs, and in the pauses between
records one could just hear the low hum of
the distant dynamos.  A little group in blue
dungarees held a conversation in a corner;
a petty officer, blue cap tilted back on his head,
was at work on a letter; the cook, whose
genial art was customarily under an interdict
while the vessel was running submerged, was
reading an ancient paper from his own home
town.
</p>

<p>
Captain Bill sat in a retired nook, if a
submarine can possibly be said to have a retired
nook, with a chart spread open on his knees.
The night before he had picked up a wireless
message saying that a German had been
seen at sundown in a certain spot on the edge
of his patrol.  So Captain Bill had planned to
run submerged to the spot in question, and
then pop up suddenly in the hope of potting
the Hun.  Some fifteen minutes before sun
down, therefore, the Z3 arrived at the place
where the Fritz had been observed.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"I wish I knew just where the bird was,"
said an intent voice.  "I'd drop a can right on
his neck."
</p>

<p>
These sentiments were not those of anybody
aboard the Z3.  An American destroyer
had also come to the spot looking for the
German, and the gentle thought recorded
above was that of her captain.  It was just
sun down, a level train of splendour burned
on the ruffled waters to the west; a light,
cheerful breeze was blowing.  The destroyer,
ready for anything, was hurrying along at a
smart clip.
</p>

<p>
"This is the place all right, all right,"
said the navigator of the destroyer.  "Come
to think of it, that chap's been reported from
here twice."
</p>

<p>
Keen eyes swept the shining uneasy plain.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, some seventy feet below, the
Z3 manoeuvred, killing time.  The phonograph
had been hushed, and every man was
ready at his post.  The prospect of a go with
the enemy had brought with it a keen thrill of
anticipation.  Now a submarine crew is a
well trained machine.  There are no shouted
orders.  If a submarine captain wants to
send his boat under quickly, he simply touches
the button of a Klaxon, the horn gives a
demoniac yell throughout the ship, and each
man does what he ought to do at once.  Such
a performance is called a "crash dive."
</p>

<p>
"I'd like to see him come up so near that we
could ram him," said the captain, gazing
almost directly into the sun.  "Find out
what she's making."
</p>

<p>
The engineer lieutenant stooped to a
voice-tube that almost swallowed up his face,
and yelled a question to the engine room.
An answer came, quite unheard by the
others.
</p>

<p>
"Twenty-four, sir," said the engineer lieutenant.
</p>

<p>
"Get her up to twenty-six," said the captain.
</p>

<p>
The engineer cried again through the voice
tube.  The wake of the vessel roared like a
mill race, the white foam tumbling rosily in
the setting sun.
</p>

<p>
Seventy feet below, Captain Bill was arranging
the last little details with the second
in command.
</p>

<p>
"In about five minutes we'll come up and
take a look-see (stick up the periscope)
and if we see the bird, and we're in a good
position to send him a fish (torpedo) we'll
let him have one.  If there is something there,
and we're not in a good position, we'll
manoeuvre till we get into one, and then let him
have it.  If there isn't anything to be seen,
we'll go under again and take another look-see
in half an hour.  Reilly has his
instructions."  Reilly was chief of the torpedo room.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Something round here must have got it
in the neck recently," said the destroyer
captain, breaking a silence which had hung
over the bridge.  "Did not you think that
wreckage a couple of miles back looked pretty
fresh?  Wonder if the boy we're after had
anything to do with it.  Keep an eye on that
sun streak."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
An order was given in the Z3.  It was
followed instantly by a kind of commotion,
sailors opened valves, compressed air ran
down pipes, the ratchets of the wheel
clattered noisily.  On the moon-faced depth gauge
with its shining brazen rim, the recording
arrow fled swiftly, counter clockwise, from
seventy to twenty to fifteen feet....
Captain Bill stood crouching at the periscope, and
when it broke the surface, a greenish light
poured down it and focussed in his eyes.  He
gazed keenly for a few seconds, and then
reached for the horizontal wheel which turns
the periscope round the horizon.  He turned
... gazed, jumped back, and pushed the
button for a crash dive.
</p>

<p>
"She was almost on top of me," he explained
afterwards.  "Coming like H&mdash;l.  I had to
choose between being rammed or depth
bombed."
</p>

<p>
There was another swift commotion,
another opening and closing of valves, and
the arrow on the depth gauge leaped forward.
Captain Bill was sending her down as far
as he could as fast as he dared.  Fifty feet,
seventy feet, ... ninety feet.  Hoping to
throw the destroyer off, the Z3 doubled on
her track.  A hundred feet.
</p>

<p>
Crash!  Depth charge number one.
</p>

<p>
According to Captain Bill, who is good at
similes, it was as if a giant, wading along
through the sea, had given the boat a vast
and violent kick, and then leaning down
had shaken it as a terrier shakes a rat.  The
Z3 rocked, lay on her side, and fell through
the depths.  A number of lights went out.
Men picked themselves out of corners, one
with the blood streaming down his face from
a bad gash over his eye.  Many of them
told later of "seeing stars" when the
vibration of the depth charge travelled through
the hull and their own bodies; some averred
that "white light" seemed to shoot out of
the Z3's walls.  Each man stood at his post
waiting for the next charge.
</p>

<p>
Crash!  A second depth charge.  To every
one's relief, it was less violent than the first.
A few more lights went out.  Meanwhile the
Z3 continued to sink and was rapidly nearing
the danger point.  Having escaped the first
two depth charges, Captain Bill hastened
to bring the boat up to a higher level.  Then
to make things cheerful, it was discovered
that the Z3 showed absolutely no inclination
to obey her controls.
</p>

<p>
"At first," said Captain Bill, "I thought
that the first depth bomb must have jammed
all the external machinery, then I decided
that our measures to rise had not yet
overcome the impetus of our forced descent.
Meanwhile the old hooker was heading for
the bottom of the Irish Sea, though I'd
blown out every bit of water in her tanks.
Had to, fifty feet more, and she would have
crushed in like an egg shell under the wheel
of a touring car.  But she kept on going down.
The distance of the third, fourth and fifth
depth bombs, however, put cheer in our hearts.
Then, presently, she began to rise.  The old
girl came up like an elevator in a New York
business block.  I knew that the minute I
came to the surface those destroyer brutes
would try to fill me full of holes, so I had a
man with a flag ready to jump on deck the
minute we emerged.  He was pretty damn
spry about it, too.  I took another look-see
through the periscope, and saw that the
destroyer lay about two miles away, and as I
looked she came for me again.  Meanwhile,
my signal man was hauling himself out of the
hatchway as if his legs were in boiling water."
</p>

<p>
"We've got her!" cried somebody aboard
the destroyer in a deep American voice full
of the exultation of battle.  The lean rifles
swung, lowered....  "Point one, lower."  They
were about to hear "Fire!" when the
Stars and Stripes and sundry other signals
burst from the deck of the misused Z3.
</p>

<p>
"Well what do you think of that?" said
the gunner.  "If it ain't one of our own gang.
Say, we must have given it to 'em hard."
</p>

<p>
"We'll go over and see who it is," said the
captain of the destroyer.  "The signals are
O.K., but it may be a dodge of the Huns.
Ask 'em who they are."
</p>

<p>
In obedience to the order, a sailor on the
destroyer's bridge wigwagged the message.
</p>

<p>
"Z3," answered one of the dungaree-clad
figures on the submarine's deck.  Captain
Bill came up himself, as the destroyer drew
alongside, to see his would-be assassin.  There
was no resentment in his heart.  The adventure
was only part of the day's work.  The
destroyer neared; her bow overlooked them.
The two captains looked at each other.  The
dialogue was laconic.
</p>

<p>
"Hello, Bill," said the destroyer captain.
</p>

<p>
"All right?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure," answered Captain Bill, to one who
had been his friend and class mate.
</p>

<p>
"Ta, ta, then," said he of the destroyer,
and the lean vessel swept away in the twilight.
</p>

<p>
Captain Bill decided to stay on the surface
for a while.  Then he went below to look
over things.  The cook, standing over some
unlovely slop which marked the end of a
half dozen eggs broken by the concussion,
was giving his opinion of the undue hastiness
of destroyers.  The cook was a child of
Brooklyn, and could talk.  The opinion was
not flattering.
</p>

<p>
"Give it to 'em, cooko," said one of the
crew, patting the orator affectionately on
the shoulder.  "We're with you."
</p>

<p>
And Captain Bill laughed.

<br /><br />
RUNNING SUBMERGED
</h3>

<p>
It was breakfast time, and the officers
of the submarines then in port had
gathered round one end of the long
dining table in the wardroom of the mother
ship.  Two or three who had breakfasted
early had taken places on a bench along the
nearer wall and were examining a disintegrating
heap of English and American magazines,
whilst pushed back from the table
and smoking an ancient briar, the senior of
the group read the wireless news which had
just arrived that morning.  The news was
not of great importance.  The lecture done
with, the tinkle of cutlery and silver, which
had been politely hushed, broke forth again.
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing this morning, Bill?"
said one of the young captains to another who
had appeared in old clothes.
</p>

<p>
"Going out at about half past nine with
the X10.  (The X10 was a British
submarine.)  Just going to take a couple of shots
at each other.  What are you up to?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I've got to give a bearing the once
over, and then I've got to write a bunch of
letters."
</p>

<p>
"Wouldn't you like to come with us?"
said the first speaker, pausing over a steaming
dish of breakfast porridge.  "Be mighty
glad to take you."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed I would," I replied with joy in
my heart.  "All my life long I have wanted
to take a trip in a submarine."
</p>

<p>
"That's fine!  We'll get you some dungarees.
Can't fool round a submarine in good
clothes."  The whole table began to take a
friendly interest, and a dispute arose as to
whose clothes would best fit me.  I am a
large person.  "Give him my extra set,
they're on the side of my locker."  "Don't
you want a cap or something?"  "Hey,
that's too small, wait and I'll get Tom's
coat."  "Try these on."  They are a wonderful
lot, the submarine officers.
</p>

<p>
I felt frightfully submarinish in my outfit.
We must have made a picturesque group.
The captain led off, wearing a tattered,
battered, old uniform of Annapolis days, I
followed wearing an old Navy cap jammed
on the side of my head and a suit of newly
laundered dungarees; the second officer
brought up the rear; his outfit consisted of
dungaree trousers, a kind of aviator's
waistcoat, and an old cloth cap.
</p>

<p>
The submarines were moored close by the
side of the mother ship, a double doorway
in the wall of the machine shop on the lower
deck opening directly upon them.  A narrow
runway connected the nearest vessel with the
sill of this aperture, and mere planks led from
one superstructure to another.  The day,
first real day after weeks of rain, was soft
and clear, great low masses of vapour, neither
mist nor cloud, but something of both, swept
down the long bay on the wings of the
wind from the clean, sweet-smelling sea; the
sun shone like ancient silver.  Little fretful
waves of water clear as the water of a spring
coursed down the alley ways between the
submarines; gulls, piping and barking, whirled
like snow flakes overhead.  I crossed to one
grey alligatorish superstructure, looked down
a narrow circular hatch at whose floor I could
see the captain waiting for my coming,
grasped the steel rings of a narrow ladder,
and descended into the submarine.  The
first impression was of being surrounded by
tremendous, almost incredible complexity.
A bewildering and intricate mass of delicate
mechanical contrivances, valves, stop cocks,
wheels, chains, shining pipes, ratchets, faucets,
oil-cups, rods, gauges.  Second impression,
bright cleanliness, shining brass, gleams of
steely radiance, stainless walls of white enamel
paint.  Third impression, size; there was
much more room than I had expected.  Of
course everything is to be seen by floods
of steady electric light, since practically no
daylight filters down through an open hatchway.
</p>

<p>
"This," said the captain, "is the control
room.  Notice the two depth gauges, two in
case one gets out of order.  That thick tube
with a brass thread coiled about it is a
periscope, and it's a peach!  It's of the
'housing' kind and winds up and down along
that screw.  The thread prevents any leak
of water.  In here," we went through a
lateral compartment with a steel door, thick
as that of a small safe, "is a space where
wee eat, sleep and live; our cook stove is that
gadget in the corner.  We don't do much
cooking when we're running submerged; in here,"
we passed another stout partition, "is our
Diesel engine, and our dynamos.  Up forward
is another living space which technically
belongs to the officers, and the torpedo room."  He
took me along.  "Now you've seen it all.
A fat steel cigar, divided into various
compartments and cram jammed full of shining
machinery.  Of course, there's no privacy,
whatsoever.  (Readers will have to guess
what is occasionally used for the phonograph
table.)  Our space is so limited that designers
will spend a year arguing where to put an
object no bigger than a soap box.  We get
on very well however.  Every crew gets used
to its boat; the men get used to each other.
They like the life; you couldn't drag them
back to surface vessels.  An ideal submarine
crew works like a perfect machine.  When we
go out you'll see that we give our orders by
Klaxon.  There's too much noise for the voice.
Suppose I had popped up on the surface
right under the very nose of one of those
destroyer brutes.  She might start to ram me;
in which case I might not have time to make
recognition signals and would have to take
my choice between getting rammed or depth
bombed.  I decide to submerge, push a button,
the Klaxon gives a yell, and every man does
automatically what he has been trained to
do.  A floods the tanks, B stands by the
dynamos, C watches the depth gauges and
so on.  That's what we call a crash dive."
</p>

<p>
"Over at the destroyer base," I said,
"they told me that the Germans were having
trouble because of lack of trained crews."
</p>

<p>
"You can just bet they are," said the
captain.  "Must have lost several boats
that way.  Can't monkey with these boats;
if somebody pulls a fool stunt&mdash;Good Night!"  He
opened a gold watch and closed it again
with a click.  "Nine o'clock, just time to shove
off.  Come up on the bridge until we get out
in the bay."
</p>

<p>
I climbed the narrow ladder again and crept
along the superstructure to the bridge which
rose for all the world like a little grey steel
pulpit.  One has to be reasonably sure-footed.
It was curious to emerge from the electric
lighted marvel to the sunlight of the bay, to
the view of the wild mountains descending to
the clear sea.  The captain gave his orders.
Faint, vague noises rose out of the hatchway;
sailors standing at various points
along the superstructure cast off the mooring
ropes and took in bumpers shaped like
monstrous sausages of cord which had
protected one bulging hull from another;
the submarine went ahead solemnly as a
planet.  Friendly faces leaned over the rail
of the mother ship high above.
</p>

<p>
Once out into the bay, I asked the second
in command just what we were up to.  The
second in command was a well knit youngster
with the coolest, most resolute blue eyes it
has ever been my fortune to see.
</p>

<p>
"We're going to take shots at a British
submarine and then she's going to have a try
at us.  We don't really fire torpedoes&mdash;but
manoeuvre for a position.  Three shots apiece.
There she is now, running on the surface.
Just as soon as we get out to deep water
we'll submerge and go for her.  Great practice."
</p>

<p>
A British submarine, somewhat larger than
our American boat, was running down the
bay, pushing curious little waves of water
ahead of her.  Several men stood on her
deck.
</p>

<p>
"Nice boat, isn't she?  Her captain's a
great scout.  About two months ago a patrol
boat shot off his periscope <i>after</i> he made it
reasonably clear he wasn't a Hun.  You
ought to hear him tell about it.  Especially
his opinion of patrol boat captains.  Great
command of language.  Bully fellow, born
submarine man."
</p>

<p>
"I meant to ask you if you weren't sometimes
mistaken for a German," I said.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, it happens," he answered coolly.
"You haven't seen Smithie yet, have you?
Guess he was away when you came.  A
bunch of destroyers almost murdered him
last month.  He's come the nearest to kissing
himself good-bye of any of us.  Going to dive
now, time to get under."
</p>

<p>
Once more down the steel ladder.  I was
getting used to it.  The handful of sailors
who had been on deck waited for us to pass.
Within, the strong, somewhat peppery smell
of hot oil from the Diesel engines floated,
and there was to be heard a hard, powerful
knocking-spitting sound from the same source.
The hatch cover was secured, a listener
might have heard a steely thump and a
grind as it closed.  Men stood calmly by the
depth gauges and the valves.  Not being a
"crash dive," the feat of getting under was
accomplished quietly, accomplished with no
more fracas than accompanies the running
of a motor car up to a door.  One instant we
were on the surface, the next instant we
were under, and the lean black arrow on the
broad moon-faced depth gauge was beginning
to creep from ten to fifteen, from fifteen to
twenty, from twenty to twenty-five....
The clatter of the Diesel engine had ceased;
in its place rose a low hum.  And of course
there was no alteration of light, nothing but
that steady electric glow on those cold, clean
bulging walls.
</p>

<p>
"What's the programme, now?"
</p>

<p>
"We are going down the bay a bit, put up
our periscope, pick up the Britisher, and
fire an imaginary tin fish at him.  After each
shot, we come to the surface for an instant
to let him know we've had our turn."
</p>

<p>
"What depth are we now?"
</p>

<p>
"Only fifty-five feet."
</p>

<p>
"What depth can you go?"
</p>

<p>
"The Navy Regulations forbid our descending
more than two hundred feet.  Subs are
always hiking around about fifty or seventy-five
feet under, just deep enough to be well
under the keel of anything going by."
</p>

<p>
"Where are we now?"
</p>

<p>
"Pretty close to the mouth of the bay.
I'm going to shove up the periscope in a few
minutes."
</p>

<p>
The captain gave an order, the arrow
on the dial retreated towards the left.
</p>

<p>
"Keep her there."  He applied his eye
to the periscope.  A strange, watery green
light poured out of the lens, and focussing in
his eye, lit the ball with wild demoniac glare.
A consultation ensued between the captain
and his junior.
</p>

<p>
"Do you see her?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, she is in a line with that little white
barn on the island....  She's heading down
the bay now....  So many points this way
(this last direction to the helmsman)
... there she is ... she's making about twelve
... she's turning, coming back ... steady
... five, ... six ... Fire!"
</p>

<p>
There was a rush, a clatter, and a stir and
the boat rose evenly to the surface.
</p>

<p>
"Here, take a look at her," said the
captain, pushing me towards the periscope.  I
fitted the eyepieces (they might have been
those of field glasses embedded in the tube)
to my eyes, and beheld again the outer world.
The kind of a world one might see in a crystal,
a mirror world, a glass world, but a remarkably
clear little world.  And as I peered, a drop
of water cast up by some wave touched the
outer lens of the tube, and a trickle big as
a deluge slid down the visionary bay.
</p>

<p>
Twice again we "attacked" the Britisher.
Her turn came.  Our boat rose to the surface,
and I was once more invited to accompany
the captain to the bridge.  The British boat
lay far away across the inlet.  We cruised
about watching her.
</p>

<p>
"There she goes."  The Britisher sank
like a stone in a pond.  We continued our
course.  The two officers peered over the
water with young, searching, resolute eyes.
Then they took to their binoculars.
</p>

<p>
"There she is," cried the captain, "in a
line with the oak tree."  I searched for a few
minutes in vain.  Suddenly I saw her, that is
to say, I saw with a great deal of difficulty
a small dark rod moving through the water.
It came closer; I saw the hatpin shaped
trail behind it.
</p>

<p>
Presently with a great swirl and roiling of
foam the Britisher pushed herself out of the
water.  I could see my young captain judging
the performance in his eye.  Then we played
victim two more times and went home.  On
the way we discussed the submarine patrol.
Now there is no more thrilling game in the
world than the game of periscope <i>vs.</i> periscope.
</p>

<p>
"What do you do?" I asked.  "Just what
you saw us do to-day.  We pack up grub
and supplies, beat it out on the high seas
and wait for a Fritz to come along.  We
give him a taste of his own medicine; given
him one more enemy to dodge.  Suppose a
Hun baffles the destroyers, makes off to a
lonely spot, and comes to the surface for a
breath of air.  There isn't a soul in sight,
not a stir of smoke on the horizon.  Just as
Captain Otto, or Von Something is gloating
over the last hospital ship he sunk, and
thinking what a lovely afternoon it is, a tin fish
comes for him like a bullet out of a gun, there
comes a thundering pound, a vibration that
sends little waves through the water, a great
foul swirl, fragments of cork, and it's all over
with the Watch on the Rhine.  Sometimes
Fritz's torpedo meets ours on the way.  Then
once in a while a destroyer or a patriotic
but misguided tramp makes things interesting
for a bit.  But it's the most wonderful service
of all.  I wouldn't give it up for anything.
We're all going out day after to-morrow.
Can't you cable London for permission to
go?  You'll like it.  Don't believe anything
you hear about the air getting bad.  The
principal nuisance when you've been under
a long while is the cold; the boat gets as raw
and damp as an unoccupied house in winter.
Jingo, quarter past one!  We'll be late for
dinner."

Some time after this article had appeared, the captain
of an American submarine gave me a copy of the
following verses written by a submarine sailor.  Poems
of this sort, typewritten by some accommodating
yeoman, are always being handed round in the Navy; I
have seen dozens of them.  Would that I knew the
author of this picturesque and flavorous ditty, for I
would gladly give him the credit he deserves.

THE RETURN OF THE CAPTAINS
</h3>

<p>
The breakfast hour was drawing to
its end, and the very last straggler
sat alone at the ward room table.
Presently an officer of the mother ship, passing
through, called to the lingering group of
submarine officers.
</p>

<p>
"The X4 is coming up the bay, and the X12
has been reported from signal station."
</p>

<p>
The news was received with a little hum of
friendly interest.  "Wonder what Ned will
have to say for himself this time."  "Must
have struck pretty good weather."  "Bet
you John has been looking for another chance
at that Hun of his."  The talk drifted away
into other channels.  A little time passed.
Then suddenly a door opened, and one after
the other entered the three officers of the
first home coming submarine.  They were
clad in various ancient uniforms which might
have been worn by an apprentice lad in a
garage, old grey flannel shirts, and stout
grease stained shoes; several days had passed
since their faces had felt a razor, and all were
a little pale from their cruise.  But the liveliest
of keen eyes burned in each resolute young
face, eyes smiling and glad.  A friendly
hullaballoo broke forth.  Chairs scraped, one
fell with a crash.
</p>

<p>
"Hello, boys!"
</p>

<p>
"Hi, John!"
</p>

<p>
"For the love of Pete, Joe, shave off those
whiskers of yours; they make you look like
Trotsky."
</p>

<p>
"See any Germans?"
</p>

<p>
"What's the news?"
</p>

<p>
"What's doing?"
</p>

<p>
"Hi, Manuelo" (this to a Philipino mess
boy who stood looking on with impassive
curiosity), "save three more breakfasts."
</p>

<p>
"Anything go for you?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, if here isn't our old Bump!"
</p>

<p>
The crowd gathered round Captain John
who had established contact (this is military
term quite out of place in a work on the Navy)
with the eagerly sought, horribly elusive
German.
</p>

<p>
"Go on, John, give us an earful.  What
time did you say it was?"
</p>

<p>
"About 5 A.M.," answered the captain.
He stood leaning against a door and the fine
head, the pallor, the touch of fatigue, all made
a very striking and appealing picture.  "Say
about eight minutes after five.  I'd just come
up to take a look-see, and saw him just about
two miles away on the surface, and moving
right along.  So I went under to get into a good
position, came up again and let him have
one.  Well, the bird saw it just as it was
almost on him, swung her round, and dived
like a ton of lead."
</p>

<p>
The audience listened in silent sympathy.
One could see the disappointment on the
captain's face.
</p>

<p>
"Where was he?"
</p>

<p>
"About so and so."
</p>

<p>
"That's the jinx that got after the convoy
sure as you live."
</p>

<p>
The speaker had had his own adventures
with the Germans.  A month or so he shoved
his periscope and spotted a Fritz on the
surface in full noonday.  The watchful Fritz,
however, had been lucky enough to see the
enemy almost at once and had dived.  The
American followed suit.  The eyeless
submarine manoeuvred about some eighty feet
under, the German evidently "making his
get-a-way," the American hoping to be lucky
enough to pick up Fritz's trail, and get a
shot at him when the enemy rose again, to
the top.  And while the two blind ships
manoeuvred there in the dark of the abyss,
the keel of the fleeing German had actually,
by a curious chance, scraped along the top
of the American vessel and carried away the
wireless aerials!
</p>

<p>
All were silent for a few seconds, thinking
over the affair.  It was not difficult to read
the thought in every mind, the thought of
<i>getting at the enemy</i>.  The idea of our Navy
is "Get after 'em, Keep after 'em, Stay after
'em, Don't give 'em an instant of security or
rest."  And none have this fighting spirit
deeper in their hearts than our gallant men
of the submarine patrol.
</p>

<p>
"That's all," said Captain John.  "I'm
going to have a wash up."  He lifted a grease
stained hand to his cheek, and rubbed his
unshaven beard, and grinned.
</p>

<p>
"Any letters?"
</p>

<p>
"Whole bag of stuff.  Smithie put it on your
desk."
</p>

<p>
Captain John wandered off.  Presently,
the door opened again, and three more veterans
of the patrol cruised in, also in ancient
uniforms.  There were more cheers; more
friendly cries.  It was unanimously decided
that the "Trotsky" of the first lot had better
take a back seat, since the second in command
of the newcomers was "a perfect ringer for
Rasputin."
</p>

<p>
"See anything?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing much.  There's a bit of wreckage
just off shore.  Saw a British patrol boat early
Tuesday morning.  I was on the surface,
lying between her and the sunrise; she was
hidden by a low lying swirl of fog; she saw
us first.  When we saw her, I made signals,
and over she came.  Guess what the old
bird wanted ... <i>wanted to know if I'd seen
a torpedo he'd fired at me</i>!  An old scout with
white whiskers, one of those retired captains,
I suppose, who has gone back on the job.
He admitted that he had received the Admiralty
notes about us, but thought we acted
suspicious....  Did you ever hear of such
nerve!"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
When the war was young, I had a year
of it on land.  Now, I have seen the war at
sea.  To my mind, if there was one service of
this war which more than any other required
those qualities of endurance, skill and courage
whose blend the fighting men so wisely call
"<i>guts</i>," it surely was our submarine patrol.
So here's to the L boats, their officers and
crews, and to the <i>Bushnell</i> and her brood of
Bantry Bay!
</p>

<p><a id="chap06"></a></p>

<h3>
VI
<br /><br />
OUR SAILORS
</h3>

<p>
In the lingo of the Navy, the enlisted
men are known as "gobs."  This word
is not to be understood as in any sense
conveying a derogatory meaning.  The men
use it themselves;&mdash;"the <i>gobs</i> on the
210."  "What does a real <i>gob</i> want with a wrist
watch?"  It is an unlovely syllable, but it
has character.
</p>

<p>
In the days before the war, our navy was,
to use an officer's phrase, more of "a big
training school" than anything else.  There
were, of course, a certain number of young
men who intended to become sailors by
profession, even as some entered the regular
army with the intention of remaining in it,
but the vast majority of sailors were "one
enlistment men" who signed on for four
years and then returned to civilian life.  The
personnel included boys just graduated from
or weary of high school, young men from the
western farms eager for a glimpse of the
world, and city lads either uncertain as to just
what trade or profession they should follow
or thirsting for a man's cup of adventure
before settling down to the prosaic task that
gives the daily bread.
</p>

<p>
To-day, the enlisted personnel of the Navy
is a cross section of the Nation's youth.
There are many college men, particularly
among the engineers.  There are young men
who have abandoned professions to enter
the Navy to do their bit.  For instance, the
yeoman who ran the little office on board
Destroyer 66 was a young lawyer who had
attained real distinction.  On board the same
destroyer was a lad who had been for a year
or two a reporter on one of the New York
papers, and a chubby earnest lad whose
father is a distinguished leader of the
Massachusetts bar.  Of my four best friends, "Pop"
had worked in some shop or other, "Giles"
was a student from an agricultural college
somewhere in western New York, "Idaho"
was a high school boy fresh from a great
ranch, and "Robie" was the son of a physician
in a small southern city.  The Napoleonic
veterans of the new navy are the professional
"gobs" of old; sailors with second enlistment
stripes go down the deck the very <i>vieux de la
veille</i>.
</p>

<p>
The sailor suffers from the fact that many
people have fixed in their minds an imaginary
sailor whom they have created from light
literature and the stage.  Just as the soldier
must always be a dashing fellow, so must the
sailor be a rollicking soul, fond of the bottle
and with a wife in every port.  Is not the
"comic sailor" a recognized literary figure?
Yet whoever heard of the "comic soldier"?
This silly phantom blinds us to the genuine
charm of character with which the sea endows
her adventurous children; we turn into a
frolic a career that is really one of endurance,
heroism, and downright hard work.  Not
that I am trying to make Jack a sobersides
or a saint.  He is full of fun and spirit.  But
the world ought to cease imagining him either
as a mannerless "rough-houser" or a low
comedian.  Our sailors have no special
partiality for the bottle; indeed, I feel quite
certain that a majority of every crew "keep
away from booze" entirely.  As for having
a wife in every port, the Chaplain says that a
sailor is the most faithful husband in the world.
</p>

<p>
As a lot, sailors are unusually good-hearted.
This last Christmas the men of our American
battleships now included in the Grand Fleet
requested permission to invite aboard the
orphan children of a great neighbouring city,
and give them an "American good time."  So
the kiddies were brought aboard; Jack rigged
up a Christmas tree, and distributed presents
and sweets in a royal style.  Said a witness of
the scene to me, "I never saw children so happy."
</p>

<p>
One of the passions which sway "the gobs"
is to have a set of "tailor-made" liberty
blues.  By "liberty blues" you are to understand
the sailor's best uniform, the picturesque
outfit he wears ashore.  Surely the uniform
of our American sailor is quite the handsomest
of all.  On such a flimsy excuse, however, as
that "the government stuff don't fit you round
the neck" or "hasn't any <i>style</i>," Jack is
forever rushing to some Louie Katzenstein in
Norfolk, Va., or Sam Schwartz of Charlestown,
Mass., to get a "real" suit made.  Endless
are the attempts to make these "a little
bit <i>different</i>," attempts, alas, which invariably
end in reprimand and disaster.  The <i>dernier
cri</i> of sportiness is to have a right hand pocket
lined with starboard green and a left hand
pocket lined with port red.  A second
ambition is to own a heavy seal ring, "fourteen
karat, Navy crest.  Name and date of
enlistment engraved free."  Sailors pay anywhere
from twenty to seventy dollars for these
treasures.  To-day, the style is to have a
patriotic motto engraved within the band.
I remember several inscribed "Democracy
or Death."  The desire of having a "real"
watch comes next in hand, and if you ask a
sailor the time he is very liable to haul out a
watch worth anywhere from a hundred and
fifty to two hundred dollars.
</p>

<p>
Our sailors are the very finest fellows
in the world to live with.  I sailed with the
Navy many thousand miles; I visited all
the great bases, and <i>I did not see one single
case of drunkenness or disorderly behaviour</i>.
The work done by our sailors was a hard and
gruelling labour, the seas which they patrolled
were haunted by every danger, yet everywhere
they were eager and keen, their energy
unabated, their spirits unshaken.
</p>

<h3>
VII
<br /><br />
THE BASE
</h3>

<p>
The town which served as the base of
the American destroyers has but
one great street; it is called The
Esplanade, and lies along the harbour edge
and open to the sea.  I saw it first in
the wild darkness of a night in early March.
Rain, the drenching, Irish rain, had been
falling all the day, but toward evening the
downpour had ceased, and a blustery south-east
wind had thinned the clouds, and brought
the harbour water to clashing and complaining
in the dark.  It was such a night as a man
might peer at from a window, and be grateful
for the roof which sheltered him, yet up
and down the gloomy highway, past the
darkened houses and street lamps shaded to mere
lifeless lumps of light, there moved a large
and orderly crowd.  For the most part, this
crowd consisted of American sailors from the
destroyers in port, lean, wholesome-looking
fellows these, with a certain active and eager
manner very reassuring to find on this side
of our cruelly tried and jaded world.  Peering
into a little lace shop decked with fragile
knickknacks and crammed with bolts of
table linen, I saw two great bronzed fellows
in pea jackets and pancake hats buying
something whose niceties of stitch and texture a
little red-cheeked Irish lass explained with
pedagogic seriousness; whilst at the other
end of the counter a young officer with grey
hair fished in his pockets for the purchase
money of some yards of lace which the
proprietress was slowly winding around a bit
of blue cardboard.  Back and forth, now
swallowed up in the gloom of a dark stretch,
now become visible in the light of a shop
door, streamed the crowd of sailors, soldiers,
officers, country folk and townspeople.  I
heard Devon drawling its oe's and oa's;
America speaking with Yankee crispness, and
Ireland mingling in the babel with a mild and
genial brogue.
</p>

<p>
By morning the wind had died down; the
sun was shining merrily, and great mountain
masses of rolling white cloud were sailing
across the sky as soft and blue as that which
lies above Fiesole.  Going forth, I found
the little town established on an edge of land
between the water and the foot of a hill;
a long hill whose sides were in places so
precipitous that only masses of dark green
shrubbery appeared between the line of
dwellings along the top and the buildings of the
Esplanade.  The hill, however, has not had
things all its way.  Two streets, rising at an
angle which would try the endurance of an
Alpine ram actually go in a straight line from
the water's edge to the high ground, taking
with them, in their ascent, tier after tier of
mean and grimy dwellings.  All other streets,
however, are less heroic, and climb the side
of the hill in long, sloping lateral lines.  A new
Gothic cathedral, built just below the crest
of the hill, but far overtopping it, dominates
and crowns the town; perhaps crushes would
be the better verb, for the monstrous bone-grey
mass towers above the terraced roofs of the
port with an ascendancy as much moral as
physical.  Yet for all its vastness and
commanding situation, it is singularly lifeless,
and only the trickery of a moonlight night
can invest its mediocre, Albert-Memorial
architecture with any trace of beauty.
</p>

<p>
The day begins slowly there, partly because
this south Irish climate is such stuff as dreams
are made of, partly because good, old
irreconcilables are suspicious of the daylight
saving law as a British measure.  There is
little to be seen till near on ten o'clock.  Then
the day begins; a number of shrewd old fish
wives, with faces wrinkled like wintered
apples and hair still black as a raven's wing,
set up their stalls in an open space by a line
of deserted piers, and peasants from near by
villages come to town driving little donkey
carts laden with the wares; now one hears
the real rural brogue, the shrewd give and take
of jest and bargain, and a prodigious yapping
and snarling from a prodigious multitude of
curs.  Never have I seen more collarless dogs.
The streets are full of the hungry, furtive
creatures; there is a fight every two or three
minutes between some civic champion and
one of the invading rural mongrels; many
is the Homeric fray that has been settled by
a good kick with a sea boot.  Little by little
the harbour, seeing that the land is at last
awake, comes ashore to buy its fresh eggs,
green vegetables, sweet milk and golden
Tipperary butter.  The Filipino and negro
stewards from the American ships arrive with
their baskets and cans; they are very popular
with Queenstown folk who cherish the delusion
that our trimly dressed, genially grinning
negroes are the American Indians of boyhood's
romance.  From the cathedral's solitary
spire, a chime jangles out the quarters,
amusing all who pause to listen with its
involuntary rendering of the first bar of "Strike
up the band; here comes a sailor."  And
ever and anon, a breeze blows in from the
harbour bringing with it a faint smell from the
funnels of the oil-burning destroyers, a smell
which suggests that a giant oil lamp
somewhere in the distance has need of turning
down.  After the lull of noon, the men to
whom liberty has been given begin to arrive
in boatloads forty and fifty strong.  The
patrollers, distinguished from their fellows
by leggins, belts, white hats, and police billie,
descend first, form in line, and march off
to their ungrateful task of keeping order where
there is no disorder; then, scrambling up
the water side stairs like youngsters out of
school, follow the liberty men.  If there is
any newcomer to the fleet among them, it
is an even chance that he will be rushed
over the hill to the <i>Lusitania</i> cemetery, a
gruesome pilgrimage to which both British
and American tars are horridly partial.  Some
are sure to stroll off to their club, some elect
to wander about the Esplanade, others
disappear in the highways and byways of the
town.  For Bill and Joe have made friends.
There have been some fifty marriages at this
base.  I imagine a good deal of match-making
goes on in those grimy streets, for the Irish
marriage is, like the Continental one, no
matter of silly sentiment, but a serious
domestic transaction.  All afternoon long, the
sailors come and go.  The supper hour takes
them to their club; night divides them
between the movies and the nightly promenade
in the gloom.
</p>

<p>
The glories of this base as a mercantile port,
if there ever were any&mdash;and the Queenstown
folk labour mightily to give you the impression
that it was the only serious rival to London&mdash;are
now over with the glories of Nineveh and
Tyre.  A few Cunard lithographs of leviathans
now for the most part at the bottom of the
sea, a few dusty show cases full of souvenirs,
pigs and pipes of black, bog oak, "Beleek"
china, a fragile, and vanilla candy kind of
ware, and lace 'kerchiefs "made by the
nuns" alone remain to recall the tourist
traffic that once centred here.  To-day, one
is apt to find among the souvenirs an
incongruous box of our most "breathy" (forgive
my new-born adjective) variety of American
chewing gum.  If you would imagine our
base as it was in the great days, better
forget the port entirely and try to think of a
great British and American naval base
crammed with shipping flying the national
ensigns, of waters thrashed by the propellers of
oil tankers, destroyers, cruisers, armed sloops,
mine layers, and submarines even.  A busy
dockyard clangs away from morning till night;
a ferry boat with a whistle like the frightened
scream of a giant's child runs back and
forth from the docks to the Admiralty pier,
little parti-coloured motor dories run swiftly
from one destroyer to another.
</p>

<p>
From the hill top, this harbour appears
as a pleasant cove lying among green hills.
On the map, it has something the outline
of a blacksmith's anvil.  Taking the narrow
entrance channel to be the column on which
the anvil rests, there extends to the right,
a long tapering bay, stretching down to a
village leading over hill, over dale to
tumble-down Cloyne, where saintly Berkeley long
meditated on the non-existence of matter;
there lies to the right a squarer, blunter bay
through which a river has worn a channel.
This channel lies close to the shore, and
serves as the anchorage.
</p>

<p>
Over the tops of the headlands, rain-coloured
and tilted up to a bank of grey
eastern cloud, lay the vast ambush, the
merciless gauntlet of the beleaguered sea.

<br /><br />
THE DESTROYER AND HER PROBLEM
</h3>

<p>
About a quarter of a mile apart, one
after the other along the ribbon of deep
water just off the shore, lie a number
of Admiralty buoys about the size and shape
of a small factory boiler.  At these buoys,
sometimes attached in little groups of two,
three, and even four to the same ring bolt,
lie the American destroyers.  From the shore
one sees the long lean hull of the nearest
vessel and a clump of funnels all tilted
backwards at the same angle.  The air above
these waspish nests, though unstained with
smoke, often broods vibrant with heat.  All
the destroyers are camouflaged, the favourite
colours being black, West Point grey and
flat white.  This camouflage produces neither
by colour nor line the repulsive and silly effect
which is for the moment so popular.  Going
aboard a destroyer for the first time, a lay
observer is struck by their extraordinary
leanness, a natural enough impression when
one recalls that the vessels measure some three
hundred feet in length and only thirty-four
in width.  Many times have I watched from
our hill these long, low, rapier shapes steal
swiftly out to sea, and been struck with the
terror, the genuine dread that lies in the
word <i>destroyer</i>.  For it is a terrible word,
a word heavy with destruction and vengeance,
a word that is akin to many an Old Testament
phrase.
</p>

<p>
Our great destroyer fleet may be divided
into two squadrons, the first of larger boats
called "thousand tonners," the second of
smaller vessels known as "flivvers."  Another
division parts the thousand tonners into those
which have a flush deck from bow to stern,
and those which have a forward deck on a
higher level than the main deck.  All these
types burn oil, the oil burner being nothing
more than a kind of sprayer whose mist of
fuel a forced draft whirls into a roar of flame;
all can develop a speed of at least twenty-nine
knots.  The armament varies with the
individual vessel, the usual outfit consisting
of four four-inch guns, two sets of torpedo
tubes, two mounted machine guns, and a
store of depth charges.
</p>

<p>
These charges deserve a eulogy of their
own.  They have done more towards winning
the war than all the giant howitzers whose
calibre has stupefied the world.  In
appearance and mechanism they are the simplest
of affairs.  The Navy always refers to them
as cans: "I dropped a can right on his head";
"it was the last can that did the business."  Imagine
an ash can of medium size painted
black and transformed into a ponderous thick
walled cylinder of steel crammed with some
three hundred pounds of T.N.T. and you
have a perfect image of one.  Now imagine
at one end of this cylinder a detonator
protected by an arrangement which can be set
to resist the pressure of water at various
levels.  A sub appears, and sinks swiftly.
If it is just below the surface, the destroyer
drops a bomb set to explode at a depth of
seventy feet.  The bomb then sinks by its
own weight to that level at which the outward
force of the protective mechanism is
over-balanced by the inward pressure of the water;
the end yields, the detonator crushes, the
bomb explodes, and your submarine is flung
horribly out of the depths almost clear of
the water, and while he is up, the destroyer's
guns fill the hull full of holes.  Or suppose
the submarine to have gone down two hundred
feet.  Then you drop a bomb geared to
that depth upon him, and blow in his sides
like a cracked egg.  The sound of these
engines travels through the water some twenty
or twenty-five miles, and there have been ships
who have caught the vibration of a distant
depth bomb through their hulls and thought
themselves torpedoed.  I once saw a depth
bomb roll off a British sloop into a half
filled dry dock; the men scrambled away like
mad, but returned in a few minutes to fish
out a "can," that had sixty more feet to go
before it could burst.  It lay on the bottom
harmless as a stone.  The charges rest at the
stern of a vessel, lying one above the other
on two sloping runways, and can be released
either from the stern or by hydraulic pressure
applied at the bridge.  The credit for this
exceedingly successful scheme belongs to a
distinguished American naval officer.
</p>

<p>
The destroyer has but one deck which is
arranged in the following manner.  I take one
of the "thousand tonners" as an illustration.
From an incredibly lean, high bow, a first
deck falls back a considerable distance to a
four-inch gun; behind the gun lies another
open space closed by a two-storied structure
whose upper section is the bridge and whose
lower section a chart room.  At the rear of
this structure the hull of the boat is cut
away, and one descends by a ladder from the
deck which is on the level of the chart room
floor, to the main deck level some eight feet
below.  Beyond this cut but one deck lies,
the mere steel covering of the hull.  Guns
and torpedo tubes are mounted on it, the
funnels rise flush from the plates; a life line
lies strung along its length, and strips of cocoa
matting try to give something of a footing.
</p>

<p>
The officers' quarters are to be found under
the forward deck.  The sleeping rooms are
situated on both sides of a narrow passageway
which begins at the bow and leads to the open
living room and dining room space known as
the ward room.  In the hull, in the space
beneath the wardroom lie the quarters of
the crew, amidships lie the boilers and the
engine room, and beyond them, a second
space for the crew and the petty officers.
A destroyer is by no means a paradise of
comfort, though when the vessel lies in a quiet
port, she can be as attractive and livable as
a yacht.  But Heaven help the poor sailor
aboard a destroyer at sea!  The craft rolls,
dips, shudders, plunges like a horse straight
up at the stars, sinks rapidly and horribly,
and even has spells of see-sawing violently
from side to side.  Its worst motion is an
unearthly twist,&mdash;a swift appalling rise at a
dreadful angle, a toss across space to the
other side of a wave, a fearful descent
sideways and down and a ghastly shudder.
"You need an iron stomach" to be on a destroyer
is a navy saying.  Some, indeed, can
never get used to them, and have to be
transferred to other vessels.

American destroyer on patrol
</p>

<p>
The destroyer is the capital weapon against
the submarine.  She can out-race a sub,
can fight him with guns, torpedoes, or depth
charges; she can send him bubbling to the
bottom by ramming him amidships.  She
can confuse him by throwing a pall of smoke
over his target; she can beat off his attacks
either above or below the surface.  He
fires a torpedo at her, she dodges, runs down
the trail of the torpedo, drops a depth bomb,
and brings her prey to the surface, an actual
incident this.  Her problem is of a dual nature,
being both defensive and offensive.  To-day,
her orders are to escort a convoy through
the danger zone to a position in latitude x and
longitude y; to-morrow, her orders are to
patrol a certain area of the beleaguered sea
or a given length of coast.
</p>

<p>
Based upon a foreign port, working in
strange waters, the destroyer flotilla added
to the fine history of the American Navy a
splendid record of endurance, heroism and
daring achievement.

<br /><br />
TORPEDOED
</h3>

<p>
If you would understand the ocean we
sailed in war-time, do not forget that it
was essentially an ambush, that the foe
was waiting for us in hiding.  Nothing real or
imagined brooded over the ocean to warn a
vessel of the presence of danger, for the waters
engulfed and forgot the tragedies of this war
as they have engulfed and forgotten all
disasters since the beginning of time.  The great
unquiet shield of the sea stretched afar to
pale horizons, the sun shone as he might
shine on a pretty village at high noon, the gulls
followed alert and clamorous.  Yet a thundering
instant was capable of transforming this
apparent calm into the most formidable
insecurity.  In four minutes you would have
nothing left of your ship and its company but
a few boats, some bodies, and a miscellaneous
litter of wreckage strewn about the scene of
the disaster.  Of the assassin there was not a sign.
</p>

<p>
All agreed that the torpedo arrived at a
fearful speed.  "Like a long white bullet
through the water," said one survivor.
"Honest to God, I never saw anything come so
fast," said another.
</p>

<p>
"Where did it strike?" I asked the first
speaker, a fine intelligent English seaman
who had been rescued by a destroyer and
brought to an American base.
</p>

<p>
"In a line with the funnel, sir.  A great
column of steam and water went up together,
and the pieces of the two port boats fell all
around the bridge.  I think it was a bit of
one of the boats that struck me here."  He
held up a bandaged hand.
</p>

<p>
"What happened then?"
</p>

<p>
"All the lights went out.  It was just dusk,
you see, so we had to abandon the boat in
the darkness.  A broken steam pipe was
roaring so that you couldn't hear a word
any one was saying.  She sank very fast."
</p>

<p>
"Did you see any sign of the submarine?"
</p>

<p>
"The captain's steward thought he saw
something come up just about three hundred
yards away as we were going down.  But
in my judgment, it was too dark to see
anything distinctly, and my notion is that he
saw a bit of wreckage, perhaps a hatch."
</p>

<p>
The next man to whom I talked was a
chunky little stoker who might have stepped
out of the pages of one of Jacobs' stories.  I
shall not aim to reproduce his dialect&mdash;it
was of the "wot abaht it" order.
</p>

<p>
"We were heading into Falmouth with a
cargo of steel and barbed wire.  I had a lot
of special supplies which I bought myself in
New York, some sugar, two very nice 'ams
and one of those round Dutch cheeses.  I
was always thinking to myself how glad my
old woman would be to see all those vittles.
Just as we got off the Scillies, one of those
bloody swine hit us with a torpedo between
the boiler room and the thwart ship bunker,
forward of the engine room, and about sixteen
feet below the water line.  Understand?
I was in the boiler room.  Down came the
bunker doors, off went the tank tops in the
engine room, two of the boilers threw out
a mess of burning coal, and the water came
pouring in like a flood.  Let me tell you that
cold sea water soon got bloody hot, the room
was filled with steam, couldn't see anything.
I expected the boilers to blow up any minute.
I yelled out for my mates.  Suddenly I heard
one of 'em say: 'Where's the ladder?' and
there was pore Jem with his face and chest
burned cruel by the flying coal, and he had
two ribs broke too, though we didn't know
it at the time.  Says 'e, 'Where's Ed?' and
just then Ed came wading through the
scalding water, pawing for the ladder.  So
up we all went, never expecting to reach the
top.  Then when we got into a boat, we 'eard
that the wireless had been carried away,
and that we'd have to wait for somebody to
pick us up.  So we waited for two days and
a Yankee destroyer found us.  Yes, both
my mates are getting better, though sister
'ere tells me that pore Ed may lose his eye."
</p>

<p>
Sometimes the torpedo was seen and avoided
by a quick turn of the wheel.  There were other
occasions when the torpedo seems to follow
a ship.  I remember reading this tale.  "At
2.14 I saw the torpedo and felt certain that
it would mean a hit either in the engine or
the fire room, so I ordered full speed ahead,
and put the rudder over hard left.  At a
distance of between two and three hundred
yards, the torpedo took a sheer to the left,
but righted itself.  For an instant it appeared
as if the torpedo might pass astern, but
porpoising again, it turned toward the ship and
struck us close by the propellers."
</p>

<p>
So much for blind chances.  One hears
curious tales.  The column of water caused
by the explosion tossed onto the forward hatch
of one merchant ship a twisted half of the
torpedo; there was a French boat struck by a
torpedo which did not explode, but lay there
at the side violently churning, and clinging
to the boat as if it were possessed of some
sinister intelligence.  I heard of a boat laden
with high explosives within whose hold a
number of motor trucks had been arranged.  A
torpedo got her at the mouth of the channel.
An explosion similar to the one at Halifax
raked the sea, the vessel, blown into fragments,
disappeared from sight in the twinkling
of an eye, and an instant later there fell
like bolides from the startled firmament a
number of immense motor trucks, one of
which actually crashed on to the deck of
another vessel!
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, I suppose, some hundred and
fifty feet or more below, "Fritz," seated at
a neat folding table, wrote it all down in
his log.

<h3>
X
<br /><br />
THE END OF A SUBMARINE
</h3>

<p>
Two days before, in a spot somewhat
south of the area we were going out
to patrol, a submarine had attacked
a convoy and sunk a horse boat.  I had the
story of the affair months afterwards from an
American sailor who had seen it all from a
nearby ship.  This sailor, no other than my
friend Giles, had been stationed in the
lookout when he heard a thundering pound,
and looking to port, he saw a column of
water hanging just amidships of the
torpedoed vessel, a column that broke crashing
over the decks.  In about three minutes the
ship broke in two, the bow and the stern
rising like the points of a shallow V, and
in five minutes she sank.  The sea was strewn
with straw; there were broken stanchions
floating in the confused water, and a number of
horses could be seen swimming about.  "All
you could see was their heads; they looked
awful small in all that water.  Some of the
horses had men hanging to them.  There
was a lot of yelling for help."  The other
ships of the convoy had run for dear life;
the destroyers had raced about like hornets
whose nest is disturbed, but the submarine
escaped.
</p>

<p>
We left a certain harbour at about three
in the afternoon.  Many of the destroyers
were out at sea taking in a big troop convoy
and the harbour seemed unusually still.  The
town also partook of this quiet, the long lateral
lines of climbing houses staring out blankly
at us like unresponsive acquaintances.  Very
few folk were to be seen on the street.  We
were bound forth on an adventure that was
drama itself, a drama which even then the
Fates, unknown to us, were swiftly weaving
into a tragedy of vengeance, yet I shall
never forget how casual and undramatic the
Esplanade appeared.  A loafer or two lounged
by the door of the public house, a little group
of sailors passed, a jaunting car went swiftly
on its way to the station; there was nothing
to suggest that these isles were beleaguered;
nothing told of the remorseless enemy at the
gates of the sea.
</p>

<p>
All night long under a gloomy, starless sky
we patrolled waters dark as the very waves
of the Styx.  The hope that nourished us was
the thought of finding a submarine on the
surface, but we heard no noise through the
mysterious dark, and a long, interminable
dawn revealed to us nothing but the high
crumbling cliffs of a lonely and ill-reputed
bay.  Where were <i>they</i> then, I have often
wondered?  When had they their last look
at the sun?  Had they any consciousness
of the end which time was bringing to them
with a giant's hurrying step?  At about six
o'clock we swung off to the southward, and
in a short time the coast had faded from sight.
</p>

<p>
From six o'clock to about half past ten we
swept in great circles and lines the mist
encircled disk of the pale sea which had been
entrusted to our keeping.  We were at hand
to answer any appeal for aid which might
flutter through the air, to investigate any
suspicious wreckage; above all, to fulfill our
function of destruction.  I have spoken
elsewhere of the terror which lurks in the word
<i>destroyer</i>.  We were hunters; beaters of the
ambush of the sea.  About us lay the besieged
waters, yellow green in colour, vexed with
tide rips and mottled with shadows of haze
and appearances of shoal.
</p>

<p>
We were on the bridge.  Suddenly a voice
called down the tube from the lookout on
the mast:
</p>

<p>
"Smoke on the horizon just off the port bow, sir."
</p>

<p>
In a little while a vague smudginess made
itself seen along the humid southeast, and
some fifteen minutes later there emerged
from this smudge the advance vessels of a
convoy.  Now one by one, now in twos and
threes, the vessels of the convoy climbed
over the dim edge of the world, a handful of
destroyers accompanying the fleet.  Almost
every ship was camouflaged, though the largest
of all, a great ocean drudge of a cargo boat,
still preserved her decency of dull grey.
A southeast wind blowing from behind the
convoy sent the smoke of the funnels over
the bows and down the western sky.  There
was something indescribably furtive about
the whole business.  The ships were going
at their very fastest, but to us they seemed
to be going very slowly, to be drifting almost,
across the southern sky.  "We advanced,"
as our report read later, "to take up a position
with the convoy."  The watch, always keen
on the 660, redoubled its vigilance.  The bait
was there; the hunt was on.  Now, if ever,
was the time for submarines.  I remember
somebody saying, "We may see a sub."  The
destroyer advanced to within three miles
of the convoy, which was then across her bow.
The morning was sunny and clear; the sun
high in the north.
</p>

<p>
"Periscope!  Port bow," suddenly cried
the surgeon of the ship, then on watch on the
bridge.  "About three hundred yards away,
near that sort of a barrel thing over there.
See it?  It's gone now."
</p>

<p>
Powerful glasses swept the suspected area.
The captain, cool as ice, took his stand by
the wheel.
</p>

<p>
"There it is again, sir.  About seventy-five
yards nearer this way."
</p>

<p>
This time it was seen by all who stood by.
The periscope was extraordinarily small,
hardly larger than a stout hoe handle, and not
more than two feet above the choppy sea.
</p>

<p>
"Full speed ahead," said the captain.
"Sound general quarters."
</p>

<p>
I do not think there was a heart there that
was not beating high, but outwardly things
went on just as calmly as they had before
the periscope had been sighted.
</p>

<p>
The fans of the extra boilers began to roar.
The general quarters alarm, a continuous
ringing, sounded its shrill call.  Men tumbled
to their stations from every corner of the ship,
some going to the torpedo tubes, some to
the guns, others to the depth charges at the
stern.  The wake of the destroyer, now
tearing along at full speed, resembled a mill
race.  And now the destroyer began a beautiful
manoeuvre.  She became the killer, the
avenger of blood.  Leaving her direct course,
she turned hard over to port, and at the point
where her curve cut the estimated course of
the German, she tossed over a buoy to mark
the spot at which the German had been seen
and released a depth bomb.  The iron can
rolled out of its chocks, and fell with a little
splash into the foaming wake.  The buoy,
a mere wooden platform with a bit of rag,
tied to an upright stick wobbled sillily behind.
For about four seconds nothing happened.
Then the seas behind us gave a curious,
convulsive lift, one might have thought that
the ocean had drawn a spasmodic breath;
over this lifted water fled a frightful glassy
tremor, and an instant later there broke forth
with a thundering pound a huge turbid
geyser which subsided, splashing noisily into
streaks and eddies of foam and purplish dust.
The destroyer then dropped three more in
a circle round the first&mdash;a swift cycle of
thundering crashes.  Meanwhile the convoy,
warned by our signal and by the uproar
turned tail and fled from the spot.  Great
streamers of heavy black smoke poured from
the many funnels, revealing the search for
speed.  In the area we had bombed, a number
of dead fish began to be seen floating in the
scum.  By this time some of the vessels from
the escort of the convoy had rushed to our
assistance, and round and round the buoy
they tore, dropping charge after charge.
The ocean now became literally speckled with
dead whiting, and I saw something that
looked like an enormous eel floating belly
upwards.

</p>

<p>
The convoy disappeared in a cloud of smoke.
Little by little the excitement died away.
Finally the only vessel left in sight on the
broad shield of the sea was another American
destroyer, our partner on patrol.  The 305
was fitted with listening devices, and she
agreed to remain behind to keep an eye and
ear open.  We were to have a word from her
every half hour.
</p>

<p>
From twelve noon to two o'clock there were
no tidings of importance.  At 2:20, however,
this laconic message sent us hurrying back to
the scene of the morning's combat.
</p>

<p>
"Signs of oil coming to surface."
</p>

<p>
What had happened in the darkness below
those yellow green waves?  I am of the
opinion that our first bomb, dropped directly
upon her, crushed the submarine in like an
egg-shell, that she had then sunk to the
bottom, and developed a slow leak.
</p>

<p>
The 660 returned through a choppy sea
to the battleground of the morning.  We
caught sight of the other destroyer from afar.
She lay on the flank of a great area defiled
by the bodies of fish, purple T.N.T. dust
and various bits of muddy wreckage which
the explosions had shaken free from the ooze.
Gulls, already attracted to the spot, were
circling about, uttering hoarse cries.  In the
heart of this disturbed area lay a great still
pool of shining water and into this pool,
from somewhere in the depths, huge bubbles
of molasses-brown oil were rising.  Reaching
the surface, these bubbles spread into filmy
pan cakes round whose edges little waves
curled and broke.

"FISHING"
</h3>

<p>
A young executive officer who had
discovered that I came from his part
of the world, took me there for tea.  I
fancy that few of the destroyer folk will
forget the principal hotel at the Navy's Irish
base.  We sat in worn plush chairs in a vast
rectangular salon lit by three giant sash
windows of horrible proportions.  Walls newly
decked with paper of a lustrous, fiery red
showered down upon us their imaginary
warmth.  The room was cold, horribly cold,
and a minuscule fire of coke burning in a tiny
grate seemed to be making no effort whatsoever
to improve conditions.  The little
glow of fire in the nest of clinkers leered
with a dull malevolence.  Cold&mdash;a shivery
cold.  My eye fled to the pictures on the fiery
wall.  How in the d&mdash;&mdash;l did these particular
pictures ever land in this particular corner
of south Ireland?  Two were photographic
studies of ragged Alabama darkies, pictures
of the kind that used to be printed on calendars
in the eighteen nineties.  One was entitled
"I want you, ma honey" (this being addressed
to a watermelon), the other being called
"I'se just tired of school."  These two were
varied by an engraving of a race horse, some
Charles I cavaliers, and a framed newspaper
photograph of the 71st New York Guards en
route for Tampa in 1898!

Sugar excepted, there is still plenty of good
food in Ireland.  The Exec. and I sat down
to a very decent tea.  I told all that I knew
about the Exec.'s friends, that A was in a
machine gun company; B in the naval aviation;
C in the intelligence department and
so forth.  And when I had done my share
of the talking, I demanded of the Exec, what
he thought of his work "over there."
</p>

<p>
He answered abruptly, as if he had long
before settled the question in his own mind:
</p>

<p>
"It's a game.  Some of the sporting fishermen
in the flotilla say that it's much like
fishing ... now you use this bait, now that,
now this rod, now another, and all the time
you are following ... following the fish....
It's a game, the biggest game in all the
world, for it has the biggest stakes in all the
world.  There's far more strategy to it than
one would suspect.  You see, it's not enough
to hang round till a periscope pops up;
we've got to fish out the periscope."
</p>

<p>
"Fishing, then," said I.  "Well, how and
where do you fish?"
</p>

<p>
"On the chequer board of the Irish Sea
and the Channel.  You see the surface of
the endangered waters is divided up into a
number of squares or areas, and over each
area some kind of a patrol boat stands guard.
She may be a destroyer, ... perhaps a
'sloop.'  Now let's suppose she's out there
looking for 'fish.'"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, even as a fisherman might wade
out into a river in which he knows that fish
are to be caught.  But how is your destroyer
fisherman to know just what fish are to be
caught, and in just what bays and inlets he
ought to troll?"
</p>

<p>
"That's the function of the Naval
Intelligence.  Have you realized the immense
organization which Britain has created
especially to fight the submarine?  You'll
find it all in the war cabinet report for
1917.  Before the war, there were only
twenty vessels employed as mine sweepers
and on auxiliary patrol duties; to-day
the number of such craft is about 3,800,
and is constantly increasing.  And don't
forget the sea planes, balloons, and all the
other parts of the outfit.  So while our destroyer
fisherman is casting about in square x, let
us say, all these scouting friends of his are
trying to find the 'fish' for him.  So every
once in a while he gets a message via wireless,
'fish seen off bay blank,' 'fish reported in
latitude A and longitude B.' ... If these
messages refer to spots in his neighbourhood,
you can be sure that he keeps an extra sharp
lookout.  So no matter where the fish goes,
there is certain to be a fisher."  <i>During a
recent month the mileage steamed by the
auxiliary patrol forces in British home waters
exceeded six million miles</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Now while you are beating the waters for
them, what about the fish himself?"
</p>

<p>
"The fish himself?  Well, the ocean is
a pretty big place, and the fish has the
tremendous advantage of being invisible.  A
submarine need only show <i>three inches</i> of periscope
if the weather is calm.  She can travel a
hundred miles completely submerged, and
she can remain on the bottom for a full
forty-eight hours.  Squatting on the bottom is
called "lying doggo."  But she has to come up
to breathe and recharge her batteries, and this
she does at night.  Hence the keenness of the
night patrol.  And here is another parallel
to fishing.  You know that when the wind is
from a certain direction, you will find the
fish in a certain pool, whilst if the wind blows
from another quarter, you will find the fish
in another place?  Same way with submarines.
Let the wind blow from a certain direction,
and they will run up and down the surface
off a certain lee shore.  You can just bet that
that strip of shore is well patrolled.
Moreover, submarines can't go fooling round all
over the sea, they <i>have</i> to concentrate in
certain squares, say the areas which lie
outside big ports or through which a great
marine highway lies."
</p>

<p>
"Suppose that you manage to injure a
fish, what then?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, if the fish isn't too badly injured,
he will probably make for one of the shallows,
and lie doggo till he has time to effect repairs.
Result, every shallow is watched as carefully
as a miser watches his gold.  And sea planes
have a special patrol of the coast to keep
them off the shallows by the shore."
</p>

<p>
"Sometimes, then, in the murk of night, a
destroyer must bump into one by sheer good
luck?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, indeed.  Not long ago, a British
destroyer racing through a pitch dark rainy
night cut a sub almost in half.  There was
a tremendous bump that knocked the people
on the bridge over backward, a lot of yelling,
and then a wild salvo of rain blotted everything
out.  I think they managed to rescue
one of the Germans.  Pity they didn't get the
fish itself.  You know it's a great stunt to
get your enemy's codes.  We get them once
in a while.  Ever seen a pink booklet on
any of your destroyer trips?  It's a translation
of a German book of instructions to
submarine commanders.  On British boats they
call it 'Baby-Killing at a Glance or the Hun's
Vade Mecum.'  Great name, isn't it?  Tells
how to attack convoys and all that sort of
thing.  Lots of interesting tricks like squatting
in the path of the sun so that the lookout,
blinded by the glare, shan't see you; playing
dead and so on.  That playing-dead stunt,
if it ever did work, which I greatly doubt,
is certainly no favourite now."
</p>

<p>
"Playing dead?  Just what do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, a destroyer would chase a sub into
the shallows and bomb her.  Then 'Fritz'
would release a tremendous mess of oil to
make believe that he was terribly injured,
and lie doggo for hours and hours.  The
destroyer, of course, seeing the oil, and hearing
nothing from 'Fritz' was expected to conclude
that 'Fritz' had landed in Valhalla, and go
away.  Then when she had gone away, 'Fritz,'
quite uninjured, went back to his job."
</p>

<p>
"And now that stunt is out of fashion?"
</p>

<p>
"You bet it is.  Our instructions are to bomb
until we get tangible results.  Before it
announces the end of a sub, the Admiralty has
to have unmistakable evidence of the sub's
destruction.  Not long ago, they say a sub
played dead somewhere off the Channel,
sent up oil, and waited for the fishers to go.
In a few seconds, 'Fritz' got a depth bomb
right on his ear, and up he came to the top, the
most surprised and angry Hun that ever was
seen.  Bagged him, boat and all.  He must
have had a head of solid ivory.
</p>

<p>
"Got to be cruising along, now.  It's four
o'clock, and our tender must be waiting for
me at the pier."
</p>

<p>
"Going fishing?" I asked politely.
</p>

<p>
"You bet!" he answered with a grin.

AMUSEMENTS
</h3>

<p>
On every vessel in the Navy there
is a phonograph, and on some
destroyers there are two phonographs, one
for the officers, and one for the men.  The
motion of the destroyer rarely permits the
use of the machine at sea, but when the vessel
lies quietly at her mooring buoy, you are
likely to hear a battered old opera record
sounding through the port holes of the ward
room, and "When the midnight choo choo
leaves for Alabam'" rising raucously out
of the crew's quarters.  When music fails,
there are always plenty of magazines, thanks
to good souls who read Mr. Burleson's offer
and affix the harmless, necessary two cent
stamps.  Each batch is full of splendid
novelettes.  We gloat over the esoteric mysteries
of the "American Buddhist," and wonder
who sent it, we read the "Osteopath's
Quarterly," the "Western Hog Breeder," and
"Needlework."  Petty officers with agricultural
ambitions, and there are always a few
on every boat, descend on the agricultural
journals like wolves on the fold.
</p>

<p>
No notice of Queenstown, no history of
the Navy would be complete without a word
about golf.  It is <i>the</i> Navy game.  Golf
clubs are to be found in every cabin; in the
tiny libraries Harry Vardon rubs shoulders
with naval historians and professors of
thermodynamics.  If you take the train, you are
sure to find a carriage full of golfers bound for
a course on the home side of the river.  I
remember seeing the captain of an American
submarine just about to start upon the most
dangerous kind of an errand one could
possibly imagine.  It was midnight; it was
raining, the great Atlantic surges were sweeping
into the bay in a manner which told of rough
weather outside.  Just as he was about to
disappear into the clamorous bowels of his
craft, the captain paused for an instant on
the ladder, and shouted back to us, "Tell
Sanderson to put that mashie in my room
when he's through with it."
</p>

<p>
Were it not for the great "United States
Naval Men's Club," I fear that Jack ashore
would have had but a dull time, for our
amusements were limited to a dingy cinema
exploiting American "serials" several years
old, and a shed in which a company of odd
people played pretentious melodramas of the
"Worst Woman in London" type on a tiny
Sunday school stage.  Alas, there were not
enough people in the company to complete
the cast of characters, so the poor leading
lady was forever disappearing into the wings
as the wronged daughter of a ducal house,
only to appear again in a few minutes as the
dark female poisoner, whilst the little leading
man with a Kerry Brogue was forever rushing
back and forth between the old white-haired
servitor and the Earl of Darnleycourt.  Once
in a while Jack came to these performances,
bought the best seat, and left the theatre
before the performance was ended.  The British
Tars, however, sat through it respectably and
solemnly to the end.
</p>

<p>
The Men's Club was to be found at one end
of the town close by the water's edge.  It was
quite the most successful and attractive thing
of its kind I have ever visited.  The largest
building was a factory-like affair of brick
which once housed some swimming baths,
then became a theatre, and finally failed
and lay down to die; the smaller buildings
were substantial huts of the Y.M.C.A. kind
which had been attached to the original
structure.  This institution provided some
several thousand sailors with a canteen, an
excellent restaurant, a theatre, a library, a
recreation room, and, if necessary, a lodging.
Best of all, one could go to the Club and
actually be warm and comfortable in the
American style, a boon not to be lightly
regarded in these islands where people all winter
long huddle in freezing rooms round lilliputian
grates.  Enlisted men controlled the club,
maintained it, and selected their stewards,
cooks and attendants from their own ranks.
Upon everybody concerned, the Club reflects
the highest credit.
</p>

<p>
There were "movies" every night, and on
Saturday night a special concert by the
"talent" in the flotilla.  The opening number
was always a selection by the Club Orchestra,
perhaps a march of Sousa's, for the Navy
is true to its own, or perhaps Meacham's
"American Patrol."  Then came a long
four-reel movie, "Jim the Penman," "The
Ring of the Borgias," "Gladiola" or "Davy
Crockett."  The last terrifying flickers die
away, the footlights become rosy; the curtain
rises on "The Musical Gobs."  We behold a
pleasant room in which two people in civilian
clothes sit playing a soft, crooning air on
violins.  Suddenly a knock is heard at the
door.  One of the performers rises, goes to
the door, then returns and says to his partner:
</p>

<p>
"There's some sailors out there (great
laughter in the audience); they say they can
play too.  Want to know if they can't come
in and play with us."
</p>

<p>
"Sure, tell 'em to come in."
</p>

<p>
"Come in, boys."
</p>

<p>
From behind the back drop, a subdued
humming suddenly bursts and blossoms into
"Strike up the band; here comes a sailor."  Enter
now three pleasant looking, amiably
grinning lads playing the tune.  Chairs are
brought out for the newcomers and the "Musical
Gobs," genuine artists all, play several
airs.  Another knock is heard and a singer,
a petty officer with a good tenor, also begs to
join them.  The curtain goes down in a perfect
tempest of applause.  The screen descends
once more, and all present sing together the
popular songs whose text is shown, "Gimme a
kiss, Mirandy," and "It's a long way to
Berlin, but we'll get there."  This feature was
always a favourite.  We then have a clog
dancer, two more comic films and the National
anthems.  When the show is over, almost
everybody wandered to the canteen to get
"a bite to eat."  To o'erleap the bars of the
ration system with a real plate of ham and
eggs, served club style, was an experience.
</p>

<p>
So if you were aboard a destroyer that
night, you would have heard Jack whistling
the new tunes, and his officers discussing golf
scores.

<h3>
XIII
<br /><br />
STORM
</h3>

<p>
Sooner or later, destroyer folk are sure
to say something about <i>the</i> storm.  It
happened in December and raged for
a full three days.  Readers will have to
imagine what it meant to destroyer sailors;
the boat dancing, tipping and rolling crazily
without a second's respite; no warm food
to eat because a saucepan could not be kept
on the stove or liquids in a saucepan; no
rest to be had.  Imagine being in the
lookout's station in such a storm, wondering
when the tops of the masts were going to
crash down on one's head.  It was a hard
time.  Yet two-thirds of the American flotilla
were out in it, and <i>not a single vessel lost
an hour from her patrol</i>.  Indeed the American
vessels were about the only patrol boats to
stay out during the tempest.
</p>

<p>
One day in the wardroom of the good old
Z, some of the officers began to tell of it.  The
first narrator was the radio officer, a tall
blond Westerner with big grey eyes, and a
little sandy moustache.
</p>

<p>
"I knew we were in for something when
I saw the clouds racing over <i>against</i> the wind.
Didn't you notice that, Duke?  It kept up
for quite a while, and kept getting colder
and colder.  It wasn't one of these squally
storms, but one of these storms that starts
with a repressed grouch, nurses it along,
and finally decides to have it out.  Whoopee!
Some night, that first one.  Everybody stayed
on their feet.  Couldn't have slept if you'd
had the chance to.  To get about, you grabbed
the nearest thing handy, hung on for dear
life, took a step, grabbed the next thing
handy and so on.  The old hooker did the
darndest stunts I ever saw or felt.  I came
in to get my coat hanging in that corner, and
the first thing I knew I was lying on the
floor over in the other corner trying to fight
my way to my feet again.  One of the men in
the boiler room got burned by being thrown
against a hot surface.  Did I tell you how I
tried to lie down?  Well, just as I had actually
succeeded in getting over to this transom
and stretching out preparatory to strapping
myself in (you have to strap yourself tight in
these destroyer bunks same as in an aeroplane)
the old craft sank or swooped or did something
more than usually funny, and left me hanging
in the air about a foot and a half above the
bunk.  I must have looked like the subject
of an experiment in levitation.  A minute
later either the bunk came up and caught me
a wallop in the back, or I fell down like a ton
of brick or we met in mid air, anyway, I
thought my spine had been carried away.
Then all of a sudden the library door opened
and dumped about a hundred pounds of books
on me.
</p>

<p>
"It was really dangerous to go on deck,
for the waves could easily have torn one
from the life line.  One of the boats did, I
think, lose a man overboard, but by wonderful
luck managed to fish him out again."  It
is the engineer officer speaking.  He is
somewhat older than the average destroyer officer;
somewhere on the edge of the forties, I should
say; of medium height, lean; and with hazel
eyes, a thin high nose and a thin, firm mouth.
"I was just getting through my watch, had
my foot on the ladder, in fact, when the boat
that we lost got smashed in.  A wave about the
size of a young mountain climbed aboard,
hit the deck, caught the boat, and then poured
off with the kindling wood.  Then to make
things interesting, right when it was blowing
the hardest, the men's dog took it into his
head to come on deck.  Of course, he was
only a three months' pup then, and didn't
know any better.  (He does now though, he
won't stick his nose out when the weather's
bad.)  Well, he slipped his collar or something,
and ran on deck.  The water was washing
about under the torpedo tubes like the
breakers at Atlantic City, and the deck plates
were buckling.  Takes a destroyer to do that.
But I keep forgetting the dog.  The little
brute backed up between two of the stacks
and started yapping out a puppyish bark at
the world to starboard.  It was funny in a
way to see the little brute there with his short
hair blown backwards and his feet braced
on the wet deck.  Everybody yelled, and one
of the men ran out hanging on to the life line,
and not a minute too soon either, for a second
later a big wave came thumping down on us,
and there was Maloney, the big dark fellow
you were talking to this morning, hanging on
to the wire by one arm, with the fool dog
squashed under the other, and the whole
Irish Sea trying to wash them both overboard.
I was afraid he'd lose his balance or have
the handle that travels along the wire torn
out of his grasp.  But he got to shelter all
right, the darn dog yapping steadily all the
time.  We had two, almost three days of it,
and it never let up one bit.  One of our boats
got caught in it with only a meagre supply
of oil, but managed to make a French port.
I've heard that there actually wasn't enough
oil left in her tanks to have taken her three
miles further.  Other destroyers, too, had
boats smashed up, and one of 'em came in
with her smokestacks bent up for all the
world like the crooked fingers of a hand.
Some had depth charges washed overboard.
It certainly was the worst blow that I remember."
</p>

<p>
Here the navigator came over with a twinkle
in his eye, and touched me on the shoulder.
</p>

<p>
"Don't let him fill you with that dope,"
said he, "that storm wasn't in it with the
storms we have on the other side off Hatteras."
</p>

<p>
"Hatteras, my neck," said the other.
"What do you think you are, anyway&mdash;Hell-Roaring
Jake the Storm King?"
</p>

<p>
And then the talk shifted to something
else.

<br /><br />
ON NIGHT PATROL
</h3>

<p>
It was the end of the afternoon, there
was light in the western sky and on the
winding bay astern, but ahead, leaden,
still, and slightly tilted up to a grey bank of
eastern cloud, lay the forsaken and beleaguered
sea.  The destroyer, nosing slowly through the
gap in the nets by the harbour mouth, entered
the swept channel, increased her speed, and
trembling to the growing vibration, hurried
on into the dark.  High, crumbling, and
excessively romantic, the Irish coast behind
her died away.  Tragic waters lay before her.
Whatever illusory friendliness men had read
into the sea had vanished; the great leaden
disk about the vessel seemed as insecure as
a mountain road down whose length travellers
cease from speaking for fear of avalanches.
"A vast circular ambush."  Somehow the
beholder cannot help feeling that the waters
should show some sign of the horrors they have
seen.  But the sea has engulfed all, memories
as well as living men, engulfing a thousand
wrecks as completely as time engulfs a
thousand years.
</p>

<p>
The dark came swiftly, almost as if the
destroyer had sailed to find it in that bank
of eastern cloud.  There was an interval of
twilight, no dying glow, but a mere pause in
the pale ebb of the day.  The destroyer had
begun to roll.  Looking back from the bridge
one saw the lean, inconceivably lean, steel
deck, the joints of the plates still visible,
the guns to each side with their attendant
crews, a machine gun, swinging on a pivot
like a weather vane, the gently swaying bulk
of the suspended motor dories and life boats,
the four great tubes of the funnels rising
flush from the plates, and crowned with a
tremble of vibration from the oil flames below.
And all this lean world swung slowly from side
to side, rocking as gently as a child's cradle,
swayed as if by some gentle force from within.
</p>

<p>
The destroyer was out on patrol.  A part
of the threatened sea had been given to her
to watch and ward.  She was the guardian,
... the avenger.
</p>

<p>
The supper hour arrived, men came in
groups to the galley door, some to depart
with steamy pannikins, there was a smell
of good food very satisfying to children of
earth.  In the officer's wardroom when dinner
was over, and the negro mess boys were
silently folding the white cloth, securing the
chairs, and tidying up, those not on watch
settled down to a friendly talk.  All the lights
except one bulb hanging over the table in
a pyramidal tin shade had been switched off.
It was very quiet.  Now and then one could
hear the splash of a wave against the side, a
footfall on the deck overhead, or the tinkle
of the knives and forks which the steward
was putting away in a drawer.  The hanging
light swayed with the motion of the ship,
trailing a pool of light up and down the oaken
table.  Cigarette smoke rose in wisps and
long, languorous oriental coils to the clean
ceiling.  A sailor or two came in for his orders.
Hushed voices talking apart, a direction to
do this or that, a respectful business-like "yes,
sir," a quiet withdrawal by the only door.
It was all very calm, it had the atmosphere
of a cruise, yet those aboard might have been
torpedoed any minute, struck a mine, crashed
into a submarine fooling about too near the
surface (this has happened) or been sunk in
thirty seconds by some hurrying, furtive
brute of a liner which would have ridden
over them as easily as a snake goes over a
branch.  The talk flowed in many channels,
on the problems of destroyers, on the
adventures of other boats, on members of the crew
soon to be advanced to commissioned rating,
and under the thought under the words, could
be discerned the one fierce purpose of these
fighting lives; the will to strike down the
submarine and open the lanes of the sea.
Oh, the vigilance, the energy, the keenness of
the American patrol!  There were tales of
U-boats hiding in suspected bays, of
merchantmen swiftly and terribly avenged, of
voices that cried for help in the night, of life
boats almost awash in whose foul waters
the dead floated swollen and horrible.  The
war of the destroyer against the submarine
is a matter of tragic melodrama.
</p>

<p>
The wandering glow of the swaying lamp
now was reflected from the varnished table
to one keen young face, now to another.
"Running a destroyer is a young man's game,"
says the Navy.  True enough.  Pray do not
imagine them, as a crew of "hell-driving
boys."  The destroyer service is the achievement
of the man in the early thirties, of the
officer with a young man's vigour and energy
and the resolution of maturity.  After all,
the Navy Department is not yet trusting
vessels worth several million dollars and
carrying over a hundred men to eager
youngsters who have no background of experience
to their energy, good-will and bravery.  If
you would imagine a destroyer captain, take
your man of thirty-two or -three, give him
blue eyes, a keen, clear-cut face essentially
American in its features, a sailor's tan, and
a sprinkling of grey hair.  A type to remember,
for to the destroyer captain more than to
any other single figure do we owe our
opportunity of winning the war.
</p>

<p>
The evening waned, the officers who were
to go on watch at twelve stole off to get a little
sleep before being called.  The navigator and
the senior engineer slept on the transoms of
the wardroom.  A junior officer lingered
beneath the solitary ever-swinging light, reading
a magazine.  A little hitch worked itself into
the destroyer's motion, a swift upward leap, a
little catch in mid air, a descent ending in
a quiver.  The voice of the waters grew louder,
there were hissing splashes, watery blows,
bubbly gurgles.
</p>

<p>
The sleeping officers had not paused to
undress.  Nobody bothers to strip on a
destroyer.  There isn't time, and a man has
to be ready on the instant for any eventuality.
</p>

<p>
The door giving on a narrow passageway
to the deck opened, and as it stood ajar, the
hissing of the water alongside invaded the
silent room.  A sailor in a blue reefer, a
big lad with big hands and simple, friendly
face, entered quietly, walked over a transom and said:
</p>

<p>
"Twelve o'clock, sir."
</p>

<p>
"All right, Simmons," said the engineer,
sitting up and kicking off the clothes at once
with a quick gesture.  Then he swung his
legs over the side of the bunk, pulled on a coat
and hat and wandered out to take his trick
at the bridge.
</p>

<p>
He found a lovely, starlit night, a night
rich in serenity and promised peace, a night
for lovers, a poet's night.  There was
phosphorescence in the water, and as the destroyer
rolled from side to side, now the guns and rails
to port, now those to starboard stood shaped
against the spectral trail of foam running
river-like alongside.  One could see some
distance ahead over the haunted plain.  The men
by the guns were changing watch; black
figures came down the lane by the funnels.
A sailor was drawing cocoa in a white enamel
cup from a tap off the galley wall.  The
hatchway leading to the quarters of the crew was
open; it was dark within; the engineer
heard the wiry creak of a bunk into which
some one had just tumbled.  The engineer
climbed two little flights of steps to the bridge.
It was just midnight.  It was very still on
the bridge, for all of the ten or twelve people
standing by.  All very quiet and rather
solemn.  One can't escape from the rich
melodrama of it all.  The bridge was a little,
low-roofed space perhaps ten feet wide and eight
feet long, it had a front wall shaped like a
wide, outward pointing V, its sides and rear
were open to the night.  The handful of officers
and men on watch stood at various points
along the walls peering out into the darkness.
Phosphorescent crests of low, breaking waves
flecked the waters about; it was incredibly
spectral.  In the heart of the bridge burned
its only light, a binnacle lamp burning as
steadily as a light in the chancel of a darkened
church, the glow cast the shadow of the
helmsman and the bars of the wheel down upon
the floor in radiations of light and shade like
the stripes of a Japanese flag.  The captain,
keeping a sharp lookout over the bow, gave
his orders now and then to the helmsman,
a petty officer with a sober, serious face.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly there were steps on the companionway
behind, the dark outline of some
messenger appeared, a shadow on a background
of shades.  The sailor peered round
for his chief and said, "Mr. Andrews sent me
up, sir, to report hearing a depth bomb or a
mine explode at 12.25."
</p>

<p>
"Was it very loud, Williams?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, I should have said that it wasn't
more than a few miles away.  We all heard
it quite distinctly down below."
</p>

<p>
Evidently some devil's work was going on
in the heart of the darkness.  The vibration
had travelled through the water and had
been heard, as always, in that part of the ship
below the water line.
</p>

<p>
Williams withdrew.  The destroyer rushed
on into the romantic night.
</p>

<p>
"Must have spotted something on the
surface," said some one....  A radio operator
appeared with a sheaf of telegrams.  "Submarine
seen in latitude x and longitude y,"
"Derelict awash in position so and so."  "Gun
fire heard off Cape Z at half past eleven"&mdash;it
all had to do with the channel zone to the
south.  The captain shoved the sheaf into
a pocket of his jacket.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, through the dark, was heard a
hard, thundering pound.
</p>

<p>
"By jingo, there's another," said somebody.
"Nearby, too.  Wonder what's up?"
</p>

<p>
"Sounded more like a torpedo this time,"
said an invisible speaker in a heavy, dogged
voice.  A stir of interest gripped the bridge;
one could see it in the shining eyes of the
young helmsman.  Two of the sailors
discussed the thing in whispers, fragments of
conversation might have been overheard.&mdash;"No,
I should have said off the port
bow."  "Isn't this about the place where the <i>Welsh
Prince</i> got hers?"  "Listen, didn't you hear
something then?"
</p>

<p>
From somewhere in the distance came three
long blasts, blasts of a deep roaring whistle.
</p>

<p>
"Something's up, sure!"
</p>

<p>
The destroyer, in obedience to an order of
the captain, took a sharp turn to port, and
turning, left far behind a curving, luminous
trail upon the sea.  The wind was dying
down.  Again there were steps on the way.
</p>

<p>
"Distress signal, sir," said the messenger
from the radio room, a shock-haired lad who
spoke with the precise intonation of a Bostonian.
</p>

<p>
The captain stepped to the side of the
binnacle, lowered the flimsy sheet into the
glow of the lamp, and summoned his officers.
The message read: "S.S. <i>Zemblan</i>, position
x y z torpedoed, request immediate assistance."
</p>

<p>
An instant later several things happened all
at once.  The "general quarters" alarm bell
which sends every man to his station began
to ring, full speed ahead was rung on in
the engine room, and the destroyer's course
was altered once more.  Men began to tumble
up out of the hatchways, figures rushed along
the dark deck; there were voices, questions,
names.  The alarm bell rang as monotonously
as an ordinary door bell whose switch has
jammed.  But soon one sound, the roaring
of the giant blowers sucking in air for the
forced draught in the boiler room, overtopped
and crushed all other fragments of noise,
even as an advancing wave gathers into
itself and destroys pools and rills left along
the beach by the tide.  A roaring sound, a
deep windy hum.  Gathering speed at once,
the destroyer leaped ahead.  And even as
violence overtook the lives and works of men,
the calm upon the sea became ironically more
than ever assuring and serene.

</p>

<p>
"Good visibility," said somebody on the
bridge.  "She can't be more than three
miles away now.  Hello, there's a rocket."
</p>

<p>
A faint bronzy golden trail, suddenly flowering
into a drooping cluster of darting white
lights gleamed for a furtive instant among
the westering winter stars.
</p>

<p>
"I saw her, sir!" cried one of the lookouts.
</p>

<p>
"Where is she, O'Farrell?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite a bit to the left of the rocket, sir.
She's settling by the head."
</p>

<p>
The beautiful night closed in again.  O'Farrell
and the engineer continued to peer out
into the dark.  Suddenly both of them cried
out, using exactly the same words at exactly
the same time, "Torpedo off the port bow, sir!"
</p>

<p>
The thing had become visible in an instant.
It could be seen as a rushing white
streak in the dark water, and was coming
towards the destroyer with the speed of
an express train, coming like a bullet out of
a gun.
</p>

<p>
The captain uttered a quick word of command.
The wheel spun, the roaring, trembling
ship turned in the dark.  A strange thing
happened.  Just as the destroyer had cleared the
danger line, the torpedo, as if actuated by some
malevolent intelligence, porpoised, and actually
turned again towards the vessel.  The fate
of the destroyer lay on the knees of the
gods.  Those on the bridge instinctively
braced themselves for the shock.  The affair
seemed to be taking a long time, a terribly
long time.  An instant later, the contrivance
rushed through the foaming wake of the
destroyer only a few yards astern, and continuing
on, disappeared in the calm and glittering
dark.  A floating red light suddenly
appeared just ahead and at the same moment
all caught sight of the <i>Zemblan</i>.
</p>

<p>
She was hardly more than half a mile away.
Somebody aboard her had evidently just
thrown over one of those life buoys with a
self-igniting torch attachment, and this buoy
burned a steady orange red just off that side
on which the vessel was listing.  The dark,
stricken, motionless bulk leaned over the little
pool of orange radiance gleaming in a fitful
pool; round the floating torch one could see
vague figures working on a boat by the stern,
and one figure walking briskly down the deck
to join them.  There was not a sign of any
explosion, no breakage, no splintered wood.
Some ships are stricken, and go to their death
in flames and eddying steam, go to their
death as a wounded soldier goes; other ships
resemble a strong man suddenly stricken by
some incurable and mysterious disease.  The
unhappy <i>Zemblan</i> was of this latter class.
There were two boats on the water, splashing
their oars with a calm regularity of the college
crews; there were inarticulate and lonely
cries.
</p>

<p>
Away from the light, and but vaguely seen
against the midnight sky, lay a British patrol
boat which had happened to be very close
at hand.  And other boats were
signalling&mdash;"<i>Zemblan</i>&mdash;am coming."  The sloop signalled
the destroyer that she would look after the
survivors.  Cries were no longer heard.  Round
and round the ship in great sweeps went the
destroyer, seeking a chance to be of use,&mdash;to
avenge.  Other vessels arrived, talked by
wireless and disappeared before they had
been but vaguely seen.
</p>

<p>
Just after two o'clock, the <i>Zemblan's</i> stem
rose in the air, and hung suspended motionless.
The tilted bulk might have been a rock
thrust suddenly out of the deep towards the
starry sky.  Then suddenly, as if released
from a pose, the stern plunged under, plunged
as if it were the last act of the vessel's conscious
will.
</p>

<p>
The destroyer cruised about till dawn.  A
breeze sprang up with the first glow of day,
and scattered the little wreckage which had
floated silly-solemnly about.  Nothing
remained to tell of an act more terrible than
murder, more base than assassination.

<br /><br />
CAMOUFLAGE
</h3>

<p>
In the annals of the Navy one may read
of many a famous duel, and if the code
duello were in existence to-day, I feel
certain that the present would not be less
fiery than the past.  The subject which stirs
up all the discussion is camouflage.  To ask
at a crowded table: "What do you think of
camouflage," is to hurl a very apple of discord
down among your hosts.  For there will be
some who will stand by camouflage to the last
bright drop of blood, and strive to win you to
their mind with tales that do "amaze the very
faculties of eyes and ears."  You will hear of
ships melting into cloud, of vessels apparently
going full speed backward, of ships whose
funnels have one and all been rendered
invisible.  And now the mocker is sure to ask
the pro-camouflager in the most serious of
tones if he ever saw the ship disguised as a
sunset which the Germans unhappily
discovered on a rainy day.  The signal gun of
the anti-camouflage squad now having
sounded, the assault begins with a demand of
"What's your theory?"  The pro's reply
something about breaking up spaces of colour,
optical illusions&mdash;"if you draw horizontal
lines along a boat's hull, she will appear
longer; if you draw vertical or angular
parallels, the vessel will appear shorter."  The
anti's answer that such an expedient
might possibly, just possibly, deceive an idiot
child for exactly five and one-eighths seconds,
as for deceiving a wily Hun,&mdash;Good Night!
"Do you mean to tell me," cries the devotee
of camouflage, growing angry, "that a ship
painted one flat, dead colour is less visible
against the sea than one whose surface is
broken up into many colours?"  "Yes, that's
what I mean," retorts the anti.  "You know
as well as I do that a thing that looks like
Vesuvius in eruption is ten times more easily
seen than a boat painted a dull neutral grey."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," cries some one else, "but hasn't
camouflage on land proved its utility?"  "I'm
talking about naval camouflage," answers
the anti.  "On land your camouflaged object
is usually stationary itself, and stands in
relation to a surface which is always
stationary,&mdash;the surrounding landscape.  Out here,
both surfaces, sea and vessel, are constantly
in motion and constantly changing their
relation to each other."  "But I <i>saw</i> a boat&mdash;"
begins a pro.  "Oh, cut it out," cries
somebody else wholeheartedly, and the discussion
ends exactly where a thousand others have
ended.
</p>

<p>
Whether camouflage be valuable or not, it
certainly is the fad of the hour.  The good,
old-fashioned, one-colour boat has practically
disappeared from the seas, and the ships that
cross the ocean in these perilous times have
been docked to make a cubist holiday; the
futurists are saving democracy.  There are
countless tricks.  I remember seeing one boat
with a false water line floating in a painted
sea whose roaring waves contrasted oddly
with a frightfully placid horizon, and I recall
another with the silhouette of a schooner
painted on her side.  I remember a little
tramp remorselessly striped, funnels and all
with alternate slanting bands of apple-green
and snuff brown; I have an indistinct memory
of a terrible mess of milky-pink, lemon-yellow
and rusty black, which earned for the vessel
displaying it the odious title of "The Boil."  We
saw the prize monstrosity in midocean.
Every school of camouflage had evidently
had a chance at her.  She was striped, she
was blotched; she was painted in curves;
she was slashed with jagged angles; she was
bone grey; she was pink; she was purple;
she was green; she was blue; she was egg
yellow.  To see her was to gasp and turn
aside.  We had quite a time picking a suitable
name for her, but finally decided on the
Conscientious Objector, though her full title
was "The State of Mind of a C.O. on Being
Sent to the Front."
</p>

<p>
Finally destiny put in my path just the man
I wanted to see, the captain of a British
submarine. "What do you think of camouflage?"
I asked.
</p>

<p>
"Well," he answered, after a pause, "I
can't remember that it ever hindered us from
seeing a ship.  Visibility at sea strikes me as
being more a matter of mass than of colour.
The optical illusion tricks are too priceless
silly.  Must amuse the Huns.  You see if the
eye does play him false, Fritz detects the
error with his gauges."
</p>

<p>
The P.C's, I am sure, will put this down as
a bit of typical submarine "side."  Indignant
letters, care H.M.S. X999.

<br /><br />
TRAGEDY
</h3>

<p>
Just at the fall of night, three days before,
a weak and fragmentary wireless had
cried forlornly over the face of the waters
for immediate help, and had then ceased
abruptly like a lamp blown out by a gust of
wind.  The destroyers, stationed here and
there in the vast loneliness of the gathering
dark, had heard and waited for "the position"
of the disaster, but nothing more came through
the night.  Presently, it had begun to rain.
</p>

<p>
And now for three interminable and tedious
days and nights rain had been falling,
falling with the monotony and purpose of
water over a dam.  There being little or no
wind the drops fell straight as plummets from
a sky flat as a vast ceiling, and the air
reverberated with that murmuring hum which is
the voice of the rain mingling with the sea.
Rain greasy with oil it had gathered from the
plates poured in little streams off the deck;
drops hissed on the iron of the hot stacks.
Clad in stout waterproof clothes, and wearing
their waterproof hoods, the crew went casually
about their duties, their hardy faces showing
no sign of discomfort or weariness.
</p>

<p>
It was about three o'clock in the afternoon
of a January day.
</p>

<p>
Presently the lookout, from his station on
the mast, reported: "Floating object off
starboard bow," and a few minutes later one of
the watch on the bridge reported two more
floating masses, this time visible to port.
The destroyer was making her way into a
vast field of wreckage.  Within the radius of
visibility, there lay, drifting silently about in
the incessant rain, an incredible quantity of
barrels, boxes, bits of wood, crates, vegetables,
apples, onions, fragments of coke, life
preservers and planks.
</p>

<p>
"See if you can spot a name on anything,"
said the destroyer's captain.  But though
everybody looked carefully, not a sign of a
name could be seen.  Mile after mile went
the destroyer down the rain lashed sea,
mile after mile of wreckage opened before
her.
</p>

<p>
"Life boat ahead showing flag!"
</p>

<p>
The captain raised to his eyes the pair of
binoculars he wore hanging from his neck,
and peered out of the window by the wheel.
</p>

<p>
"Found her yet, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes ... it's a small grey boat.  Barely
afloat, I guess.  They've got a shirt or
something tied to a mast or an oar.  We'll have a
look at it.  Tell Mullens to have a couple of
men stand by with boat hooks in case we
run alongside."
</p>

<p>
The swamped boat, motionless as a stone
in the driving rain, lay no more than half a
mile off.  Voices eagerly discussed the
possibility of finding survivors.
</p>

<p>
"Alive?  Course they ain't.  Why, the boat's
awash."
</p>

<p>
"Sure, but look at the flag."
</p>

<p>
"Those poor guys are gonners long ago."
</p>

<p>
Handled skilfully the destroyer crept alongside
the motionless boat, and presently those
on the bridge looked directly down upon it.
It lay, floating on even keel, not more than
six or seven feet off the starboard side, and was
held up by its tanks.  A red flannel shirt hung
soggily against an upright pole, and coloured
the shaft with the drippings of its dye.  The
interior of the boat was but a deep puddle,
a dark puddle into which the rain fell
monotonous and implacable.  Floating face down
and side by side in the water lay the fully
clothed bodies of two men, whilst at the
stern, sitting on a seat just under water,
with his feet in the water and his body toppled
over on the gunwale, could be seen a third
figure dressed in a kind of seaman's jacket.
The wet cloth of his trousers clung lightly
to his thin legs and revealed the taut muscles
of his thighs.  Then boat hooks fished out from
the side of the destroyer and drew the heavy
craft in.  A sailor cried out that all were
dead.
</p>

<p>
"Any name on the boat, Hardy?" asked the
officer standing by.
</p>

<p>
"No, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Very well.  Cast off!"  The life boat,
watched by some rather horrified eyes, slid
alongside the destroyers, and drifted solemnly
behind.
</p>

<p>
"Now," said the captain, who had come on
deck, "I want one tidy shot put into that boat,
Butler."
</p>

<p>
Ten seconds later, the roar of the four-inch
at the stern burst asunder the murmur of
the rain, and the watchers saw the boat of
the dead crumple and disappear in the
loneliness and rain.

<br /><br />
"CONSOLIDATION, NOT COÖPERATION"
</h3>

<p>
Talking one day with an English
member of the House of Commons, I
asked him what he held to be the
most important result of American intervention.
</p>

<p>
"The spirit of coöperation which you
have stirred up among the Allies," he answered.
"Not that I mean to say that the Allies were
continually quarrelling among themselves;
the manner in which Britain has shared her
ships with other hard pressed nations would
refute any such insinuation, but not until
you came on the scene was there a really
scientific attempt at the coördination of our
various forces.  You were quite right to insist
on a generalissimo.  But of course the great
lesson you've given us has been through your
Navy.  There's been nothing like it in
the history of the allied forces.  What an
extraordinary position Admiral Sims has won
in England!  His influence is perfectly
tremendous; there isn't another allied leader
who has a tithe of his power.  I really do not
think that there is a parallel to it in English
history."
</p>

<p>
Now this is no over-statement of the case.
The influence of Admiral Sims over the
British people <i>is</i> tremendous.  All along he
has had but one watchword, "Consolidation,
not Coöperation."  It is a splendid phrase,
and Admiral Sims has turned it into action.
The way, I gathered from various members
of the Staff and the Embassy, had not been
without its obstacles.  For instance, once
upon a time certain American forces were to
be sent into a distant area, and a member of
the Allied Naval Council sitting in London
had taken the stand that the little force
should be supplied from the United States.
Immediately Admiral Sims pointed out that
these American forces must be considered as
<i>allied</i> forces and must be supplied from the
nearest and most convenient <i>allied</i> sources
of supply.  And he carried the day.  Not
only has the Admiral insisted on the <i>consolidation</i>
of material forces; but he has also
insisted on a consolidation of the allied spirit.
Himself a master of diplomacy and tact,
he loses no opportunity of reminding the
individual officers under his control to bear
in mind the good points of other services
and to remember the fact that the success
of this work would be directly affected by
their relations with their comrades of the
Great Cause.  And this extraordinary
consolidation of force and spirit is precisely the
thing which more than anything else takes
the attention of the visiting correspondent.
"Consolidation, not Coöperation"&mdash;it is a
phrase that well might have been our allied
motto from the first.
</p>

<p>
While in London, I had several talks with
Admiral Sims in his office in Grosvenor
Gardens.  Of the many distinguished men it
has been my lot to interview, Admiral Sims
stands first for the ability to put a guest at
ease.  Tall, spare, erect, and walking with a
fine carriage, our Admiral is a personality
whom the interviewer can never forget.  One
has but to talk with him a few minutes to
realize the secret of the extraordinary personal
loyalty he inspires.  And he is as popular
in France as he is in England.  Speaking
French fluently, he is able to carry on
discussion with the French members of the Naval
Council in their own language.
</p>

<p>
"Consolidation, not Coöperation."  There's
a real phrase.  And thanks to the great man
who said it and insisted upon it, we defeated
the common enemy.

XVIII
<br /><br />
MACHINE AGAINST MACHINE
</h3>

<p>
The year stood at the threshold of
the spring; a promise of warmth
lay in the climbing sun; on land one
might have heard the first songs of the birds.
At sea, the mists of winter were lifting from
the waters, and the sun, for many months
shrunk and silver pale, shone hard and
golden bright.  A fresh, clear wind was
blowing from the west, driving ahead of it a
multitude of low foam-streaked waves.  There was
not a sign of life to be seen anywhere on the
vast disk of the sea, not a trail, not a smudge
of smoke on the horizon's circle, not even a
solitary gull or diver.  The destroyer, dwarfed
by her world, ran up and down the square she
had been chosen to guard.  She had the air
of performing a casual evolution.  There was
never anything to be found in this particular
square.  It lay beyond the great highways;
even the sight of a coaster was there something
of a rarity.  Periscopes were never reported
from that area, never had been reported,
and probably never would be.  Caressed by
the sun, enveloped in the serenity of the day
as in a mantle, the destroyer went back and
forth on her patrol.
</p>

<p>
The emergence of the periscope a quarter
of a mile ahead off the starboard bow had
in it something so unattended that the incident
had a character of abnormality ... much as
if a familiar hill should suddenly turn into a
volcano.  It is greatly to the honour of
the ship's discipline, that those aboard were
not staled by months of unfruitful vigil,
and acted as swiftly as if the destruction of
a submarine were matter of daily practice.
There it lay, going steadily along about two
hundred yards away, ... a simple, most
unromantic black rod rising two feet or so
above the waves.  A white furrow like a kind
of comet's tail, streamed behind it, forever
widening at the end.  Later on, they asked
themselves what the submarine could possibly
have been doing.  Seeking a quiet place to
come up to breathe, to effect repairs, to send
out a hurried wireless message?
</p>

<p>
It might have been a rendezvous between
the two vessels.  One felt that the gods had
brought to pass there no careless drama, but
a tragedy long meditated and skillfully
prepared.  The morning sun watched, a casual
spectator, the duel between the two engines
of violence.
</p>

<p>
There had been a command, a call of the
summoning bell, a release of power carefully
stored for just such an event, and the destroyer
leaped ahead like a runner from the starting
line.  The periscope, meanwhile, continued to
plough its way straight ahead almost into the
teeth of the wind and the flattened, marbly
waves.  Presently, either because the destroyer
had been seen or heard on the submarine
telephone, the submarine began to submerge,
sucking in a kind of a foaming hollow as she
sank.  Aboard the destroyer, they wondered
if the keel would clear her, and waited for
the shock, the rasping grind.  But nothing
happened.  The first depth bomb fell into
the heart of the submarine's swirl even as
a well placed stone falls in the heart of a
pool.  Trembling to the roar of her fans,
the destroyer fled across the spot, and turned.
The wake of her passing had almost
obliterated the platter-shaped swirl the
submarine had left behind; one had a vision of
the great steel cylinder tumbling, bubbling
down through green water to dark, harmless
as a spool of thread on the surface, but
presently to be changed by the wisdom and
cunning of men into monstrous and chaotic
strength.  One, two, three, four, five ... a
thundering pound....  The submarine rose
behind them, her bow on the crest of the
geyser, an immense, tapering rusty mass, wet and
shining in the placid glance of the day.  From
a kind of hole some distance up the side, a
stream of oil ran much like blood from a small
deep wound....  A gun spoke, and spoke
again, a careening whizz, ... ugly hollow
crashes of tearing steel ... the sub heeled
far over on her starboard side ... those
nearest heard, or thought they heard,
screaming ... the bow sank, tilting up the great
planes and propellers.  A monstrous bubble
or two broke on the tormented surface just
before she disappeared ... and with her
going, the calm of the spring morning, which
had been frightened away like a singing bird,
returned once more to the tragic and mysterious sea.

THE LEGEND OF KELLEY
</h3>

<p>
Kelley, not Von Biberstein or Hans
Bratwurst, is his name, Kelley spelled
with an "e."  The first destroyer officer
whom you question will very possibly have
never heard of him, the second will have
heard the legend, the third will tell you of a
radio officer, a friend of his, who received one
of Kelley's messages.  So day by day the
legend grows apace.  Kelley is the captain of
a German submarine.
</p>

<p>
The first time that I heard about him he
figured as a young Irishman of good family
who had attached himself to the German
cause in order to settle old scores.  "Lots of
people know him in the west of Ireland; he
goes ashore there any time he cares
to."  Another version, perhaps the true one, if
there be any truth at all in this fantastic
business, is that Kelley is no Irishman but a
cosmopolitan, jesting German with a Celtic
camouflage.  No less a person than Captain
James Norman Hall testifies that the Germans
in the trenches often tried to anger the
British troops by pretending they were
disloyal Irish.  So perhaps Kelley is Von
Biberstein after all.  A third version has it that
Kelley is a Californian of Irish origin.  Those
who hold to this last view have it that Kelley
spares all American ships but sends the Union
Jack to the bottom without mercy.
</p>

<p>
Many and varied are Kelley's activities.
He has penchant for sending messages.  "I
am in latitude x and longitude y; come and
get me&mdash;Kelley," has come at the dead
of night into the ears of many an astounded
radio operator.  Others declare that these
messages were sent by Hans Rose, the skipper
of the submarine which attacked the shipping
off Nantucket in 1916.  All agree that Kelley
was the beau ideal of pirates.  He sinks a ship
and apologizes for his action, he sees the women
passengers into the boats with the grace and
urbanity of a Chesterfield, he comes alongside
a wretched huddle of survivors, supplies them
with food, and sends out notice of their
position.  When they ask his name, he replies
"Captain Kelley," and disappears from view
beneath the sea.  He goes ashore, and proves
his visit with theatre tickets and hotel bills.
"London hotel bills made out to Kelley,
Esquire."  He requests the survivors as a
slight favour to tell Captain Nameless of the
Destroyer XYZ that his propeller shaft needs
repairing; that he, Kelley, has been seriously
annoyed by having to listen to the imperfect
beat via the submarine telephone.  There is
certainly a flavour of Celt in this chivalry
tinged with mockery.
</p>

<p>
I could never find anybody who had actually
seen him, much to my regret, for I should have
been glad to describe so famous a person.
Months have passed since last I heard of him.
Perhaps he is still in the Irish Sea; perhaps
he is now at Harwich, perhaps he has gone
aloft to join his kinsman "The Flying
Dutchman."  If so, let us keep his memory green,
for he was a pirate <i>sans peur et sans reproche</i>.

SONS OF THE TRIDENT
</h3>

<p>
Any essay on the British sailor must
rise from a foundation of wholesome
respect.  One cannot look at the
master of the world without philosophy.
And British Jack is the world's master, for
he holds in his hands that mastery of the seas
which is the mastery of the land.  He is a
sailor of the mightiest of all navies, an inheritor
of the world's most remarkable naval tradition,
a true son of Britannia's ancient trident.
</p>

<p>
What is he like, British Jack?  How does
he impress those companions who share the
vigil of the seas?
</p>

<p>
To begin with the Briton is, on the average,
an older man than our bluejacket.  British
Jack has not gone into the Royal Navy "for
the fun of it" or "to see the world," as our
posters say, but as the serious business of
his life.  His enlistment is an eight-year
affair, and by the time that he has completed
it, he rarely thinks of returning to a prosaic
life ashore.  Thus it comes about that whilst
our American sailors are usually somewhere
in the eager, irresponsible twenties, British
tars are often men of sober middle age.  One
is sure to see, in any of the "home ports,"
the fleet's married men out walking on Sunday
with their wives and children, forming
together a number of honest, steady little
groups whose hold on the durable satisfactions
of life it is a pleasure to see.  The "home
ports" idea has well proved its value.  It
is simple enough in operation.  Each ship,
according to the plan, bases on some definite
port, thus permitting poor Jack (who has
enough of roaming at sea) to have a steady
home on land.  In all the great British bases,
therefore, you will find these sailor colonies.
I was well acquainted with a retired Navy
chaplain who ministered to such a group.
These families form a distinct group dependent
on the Navy.  Marriages are performed by
the naval chaplain, the ills of the flesh are
looked after by the fleet surgeons, and the
rare troubles are brought to the judgment of
Jack's favourite officers.
</p>

<p>
Our American crews are gathered together
from all over the vast continent, British crews
are often recruited from one section of the
country.  For instance, a ship manned by a
crew from "out o' Devon" is known as a "West
Country" ship and its sailors as "Westos."  A
real Royal Navy man knows in an instant
the character of any ship which he happens
to visit.  The drawled "oa's" and oe's" of
the West tell the story.  I once heard a
"Westo" refer to an officious wharf tender as
a "bloody to-ad," a phrase that certainly has
character.  Then there be ships based on
Irish ports.  Indeed, there are sure to be Irish
sailors on every ship, irresponsible,
keen-witted Celts to whom all devilment is
entrusted.
</p>

<p>
The war has not been without influence
on the naval personnel.  British Jack had,
in his own social system, a place of his own.
He is not looked down upon, for the British
bluejacket has been, is, and forever ought
to be the best loved of national figures.  Sons
of "gentlemen," however, I use the word
here in its British sense, did not join the Royal
Navy as enlisted men.  Such a thing would
have been regarded as "queer" (no mild
word, in Britain), and the crew certainly
would have looked upon any such arrival as
an intruder.  But just as the war has placed
University men side by side in the ranks with
troopers like Kipling's Ortheris, so has it
placed among the enlisted personnel of the
Royal Navy a large number of men from the
educated and wealthier class.  There hung in
the Royal Academy this spring a portrait
of a British bluejacket, a pleasant-looking
lad some nineteen or twenty years of age
with blond hair, a long face and honest eyes
of English grey.  It was entitled "My Son."  Almost
invariably the older visitors to the
exhibition, when looking at this picture,
would fall to talking of the change in the
social system which the portrait symbolized.
</p>

<p>
There are always a number of boys on British
ships, for the British hold that to be a good
sailor, one should early become familiar with
the sea.  The status of "boy" is a kind of
distinct rating, and these youngsters are
addressed by their last names, viz., Boy
Bumblechook or Boy Stiggins.  They have
shown up wonderfully well.  One has but to
recall little Cornell of Jutland to see of what
stuff these lads are made.
</p>

<p>
The British sailor's uniform is picturesque
and characteristic, but certainly less attractive
than ours.  It is cut not of broadcloth or of
serge, but of heavy blue worsted, and a detachable
collar of blue linen falls back upon the
blouse.  Our sailors are forever washing the
blouses to keep the white stripes of the
collar clean; the Briton has only his collar
to care for.  And there is a difference between
the national builds as marked as the difference
twixt the uniforms.  Our Jack is rangy, lean
and quick-moving, the Briton heavier, shorter,
and more deliberate.  In hours of leisure,
the Briton busies himself with knitting,
wood-carving or weaving rag rugs; the American,
driven by the mechanical genius of the nation,
hurries to the ship's machine shop to pound
a half-crown into a ring.
</p>

<p>
The sons of Columbia and the sons of
Britannia get on very well together.  At the
big club house at the Irish base, there are
always little groups of British sailors to be
seen, quiet, well-behaved fellows who watch
everything with British dignity.  Our
bluejackets, however, are far more chummy
with British soldiers than with Britons of
their own calling.  Navy blue and khaki
are forever going down the street arm in arm.
The tar is always keen to hear of the front.
Tommy does the talking.  After all, there is
a difference in the vernacular.  Witness this
poem which I reprint from the August number
of <i>Our Navy</i>.  It is by a Navy man,
Mr. R. P. Maulsley.  The word Limey, here
shortened to "Lima," means, used as a noun,
a British sailorman; used as an adjective,
British.  The term had its origin in the ancient
British custom of giving lime juice to ward
off scurvy.

THE FLEET
</h3>

<p>
The fleet lay in the Firth of Forth.
It was one o'clock in the afternoon,
and the little suburban train which
leaves and pauses at the Edinburgh Grand
Fleet pier had not yet been brought to its
platform.  The cold sunlight of a northern
spring fell upon the vast, empty station,
and burnished the lines of rail beyond the
entrance arch.  Two porters from the adjoining
hotel, wearing coats of orange-red with
dull brass buttons, stood lackadaisically by
a booking office closed for the dinner hour.
Presently, after a piercing shriek intensified
by the surrounding quiet, the suburban
train backed in with a smooth, crawling noise.
Various folk began to appear on the platform,
a group of young British naval officers, a
handful of older sailors, a captain carrying a
small leather affair much like a miniature
suit-case, a number of civilians, two "Jacks"
evidently on furlough, and a young sailor
lad with a fine bull terrier bitch on a leash.
No one entered to share my compartment.
The train left behind the clean, grim town
... rolled on through suburbs and through
fields barely awake to the spring ... paused
here and there at tidy, little stations
... reached the station above the pier.  Somewhat
uncertain of my path to the landing, I
followed a group of officers.  A middle-aged
soldier sentry with grey hair and ruddy cheeks
held me up for my pass, unfolded and folded
it again with extraordinary deliberation, and
courteously set me on my way.  As yet there
was no sign of the sea, nor had it once been
visible during the journey.  One might have
been on the way to play golf at an inland
field.  The path to the pier descended a great
flight of steps and passed a space in which
men were playing football....  A turn down
a bit of road, and I was looking at the fleet.
</p>

<p>
It lay in the great firth, in a monstrous
estuary enclosed between barren banks rising to no
great height.  Bare, scattered woodlands were
to be seen, a clump of cottages, a castellated
house in a solitary spot, a great wharf with
a trumpery traveller's bookstall in a wooden
shed at its entrance, a huddle of grey roofs
at the water's edge on the distant side.  Over
a spur of land the smoke of a giant dockyard
rose in a hazy reek to the obscured and silvery
sun.  The water in which the squadrons
lay was for the moment as calm as a woodland
pool; in colour, green-grey....  An incredible
number of ships of war lying lengthwise
in orderly lines, bows turned to the unseen
river of the rising tide, ... row after row,
squadron after squadron, fleet after fleet,
ships of war, dark, terrible and huge, no more
to be counted than the leaves of trees.  As
far as the eye could reach up and down the
firth, ships.  One beheld there the mastery
of the sea made visible, the mastery of all
the highways and the secret paths of the
waters of earth.  Because of this fleet ships
were able to bring grain from distant fields,
great hopes were kept aflame, and the life
blood of evil ambitions poured upon the
ground.  A grey haze lay at the mouth of
the roads and somewhere in the heart of it
was target practice being held, for violent
blots of light again and again burst open
the dim and veiling fog.  Small gulls passed on
motionless wings, whistling.  Now and then
a vessel would run up a tangle of flags.  The
signal light of a flagship suddenly uttered a
message with intermittent flashes of an
unnatural violet white glare.
</p>

<p>
Over earth and sea brooded the peace of
empire.

THE AMERICAN SQUADRON
</h3>

<p>
The morning found me a guest aboard
the flagship of the American battleship
squadron attached to the Grand
Fleet.  Going on deck, I found the sun
struggling through thin, motionless mists.  A
layer of webby drops lay on wall and rail,
on turret and gun.  Presently a little cool
wind, blowing from the land, fled over the
calm water in mottled, scaly spots, bringing
with it a piping beat of rhythmic music.  Half
a mile beyond the flagship, the crew of a
British warship were running in a column
round and round her decks to the music
of the ship's band.  An endless file of white
clad figures bent forward, a faint regular
tattoo of running feet.  Round and about
several of the giants were signalling in blinker.
Beyond us stood a titanic bridge, whose
network was here and there smouched with
clinging vapour, and beneath this giant, a
tanker laden with oil for the fleet passed
solemnly, followed by wheeling gulls.
Presently two American sailors, lads of that
alert, eager type that is so intensely and
honestly American, popped out of a doorway
and began to polish bright work.
</p>

<p>
America was there.
</p>

<p>
Surely it was one of the finest thoughts of
the war to send this squadron of ours.
Putting aside for the instant any thought of the
squadron as a unit of naval strength,
Americans and Britons will do well to consider
it rather as a splendid symbol of a union
dedicated to the most honourable of purposes,
to the defence of that ideal of fraternity and
international good faith now menaced.  They
say that when the American squadron came
steaming into the fleet's more northern base
one bitter winter day, cheer after cheer
broke from the British vessels as they passed,
till even the forlorn, snow-covered land rang
with the shouting.
</p>

<p>
It has recently been announced that our
battleship squadron is under the command
of Admiral Hugh Rodman, which announcement
the Germans must have taken to heart,
for Admiral Rodman is a man of action if ever
one there was.  Tall, strongly built, vigorous
and alert, he dominates whatever group he
happens to find himself in by sheer force of
personality.  It would fare ill with a German
who brought his fleet under the sweep of those
keen eyes.  Admiral Rodman is a Kentuckian,
and a union of blue grass and blue sea is
pretty hard to beat, especially when
accompanied by a shrewd sense of humour.
</p>

<p>
I talked with Admiral Rodman about the
squadron and its work.
</p>

<p>
"Always remember," said he, "that this
squadron is not over here, as somebody put
it, 'helping the British.'  Nor are we 'coöperating'
with the British fleet.  Such ideas are
erroneous, and would mislead your readers.
Think of this great fleet which you see here
as a unit of force, controlled by one ideal, one
spirit and one mind, and of the American
squadron as an integral part of that fleet.
Take, as an instance of what I mean, the
change in our signalling system.  We came
over here using the American system of
signals.  Well, we could not have two sets of
signals going, so in order to get right into
things, we learned the British signals, and it's
the British system we are using to-day....
There are American <i>ships</i> here and British
ships but <i>only one fleet</i>.
</p>

<p>
Everywhere I went, I found both British
and American officers keen to emphasize
this unity.  Said a Briton&mdash;-"Why we no
longer think of the Americans of 'the Americans';
we think of squadron X of the fleet.
It's just wonderful the way your chaps have
got down to business and fallen in with the
technique and the traditions.  We expected
to see you spend some time getting into the
life of the fleet and all that, you know; the
sort of thing that a boy in a public school
goes through before he gets the spirit and the
ways of the place, but your people came
along in the morning and had picked up
everything by the afternoon."  And I found
the Americans proud of the fleet's essential
oneness, proud to share in its great tradition,
and to be a part of its history.  America is
taking no obscure place.  Her hosts have
given her the place of honour in the battle line.
</p>

<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-156.jpg" alt="An American battleship fleet leaving the harbor" />
<br />
An American battleship fleet leaving the harbor
</p>

<p>
Battle&mdash;that was the thought of everybody
aboard the fleet.  If only the German "High
Canal" fleet would really come out and fight
it to a finish, or as an American lieutenant
put it, "start something."  The Germans,
however, knew only too well that the famous
betoasted <i>Der Tag</i> would turn swiftly into
a <i>Dies Iræe</i> and preferred to surrender.  So
for lack of an antagonist, the fleet had to be
content to keep steam up all the time and to
know that everything was prepared for a day
of battle.  But the fleet did far more than
wait.  No statement of the Germans was
more empty of truth than the silly cry that
the British fleet lies "skulking in harbour for
fear of submarines."  The fleet was busy all
the time.  Again and again, a visible defiance,
it swept by the mine sealed mouths of the
German bases.  For five years now, the fleet
has been on a war footing prepared for instant
action, a tremendous task this.  "If they only
had come out, the beggars."
</p>

<p>
A day with the fleet in port passed casually
and calmly enough.  There was none of that
melodrama which invests the war of the
destroyer and the submarine, and human
problems seemed to lack importance, for in
the fleet man is somewhat shadowed by the
immense force he has created.  On board
there were various drills, perhaps a general
quarters practice drill that sends everybody
scurrying to his station.  Hour after hour, the
visitor sees the continuous and multitudinous
activity needed to keep a dreadnaught in
shape as a fortress, an engine, and a ship.
Then, when the evening has come, such officers
as are off duty may sit down to a game
of bridge or go to their rooms to read or study
quietly.  There are great days when kings and
queens come aboard and are royally
entertained.  Twice a week the entertainment
committee of the fleet sent round a steel
box full of "movies."  However, everybody
enjoys them, and laughs.  But it is good to
escape on deck again, and see the squadron
and the fleet beneath the haloed moon.
</p>

<p>
The shores about are quite in darkness,
though now and then a glow appears over
the hidden dockyard as if some one there
had opened a furnace door.  A little breeze
is blowing a thin, flat sheet of cloud across
the moon; one can hear water slapping
against the sides.  The sailors on watch walk
up and down the decks, shouldering their
guns.  In the light one might believe the
basketry of the woven masts to be spun of
delicate silver bars.  Behind us ride the other
vessels of the squadron, a row of dark, triangular
shapes.  The great columnar guns, sealed
with a brazen plug, seem mute and dead.
The curtain of a hatchway parts, and a little
group of officers come on deck to watch a
squadron go to sea.  One by one the vessels,
battleships and attendant destroyers glide
past us into the dark, and so swift and silent
their motion is that they seem to be less
self-propelled than drawn forward by some
mysterious force dwelling far beyond in the
moonlit sea.  A slight hiss of cleaving water,
the length of a hurrying grey fortress beneath
the moon, and the last of the squadron
vanishes down the roads.  For a little time
one may see the diminishing glares of blinker
lights.  Squadrons of various kinds are
forever leaving a fleet base to go on mysterious
errands, squadrons are ever returning home
from the mystery and silence of the sea.
</p>

<p>
A friend comes to tell me that we have been
put on "short notice," and may leave at any
instant.

<br /><br />
TO SEA WITH THE FLEET
</h3>

<p>
On the morning of the day that the
fleet went out, there was to be felt
aboard that tensity which follows on
a "short notice" warning.  Officers rushed
into the wardroom for a hasty cup of coffee
and hurried back to their beloved engines;
the bluejackets, too, knew that something
was in the air.  A visitor to the flagship
will not have to study long the faces of his
hosts to see that they are an exceptional
lot of men.  Whilst among the destroyers
there is a good deal of the grey-eyed
ram-you, damn-you type; on a battleship there
is a union of the elements of thought and
action which is very fine to see.  Nor is the
artist element lacking in many a countenance.
I remember a chief engineer whose ability
as an engineer was a word in the fleet; it
was easy to see, when he took you through
his marvellous engine room, that he enjoyed
his labour as much for the wonder of the
delicacy, the power and the precision of his
giant engines as he did for their mere
mechanical side of pressures and horsepower.  Nor
shall I ever see a more perfect example of
coördination and competence than a turret
drill at which I was invited to assist.  From
the distinguished young executive to the
lowest rated officer in "the steerage," every
man brought to his task not only an expert's
understanding of it, but a love of his work,
which, I think it is Kipling that says it, is
the most wonderful thing in all the world.
The vessel was very much what Navy folk
call a "happy ship."  I must say the prospect
of going out with the fleet and with such a
wonderful crowd did not make me keenly
miserable.  "If they only would come out,
ah, if...!"
</p>

<p>
"So we are still on an hour's notice," I
said to one of my hosts in the hope of getting
some information.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, back again.  At two o'clock this
morning the time was extended, but after
seven we were put back on short time once
more."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose the time is always shifting and
changing?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, indeed.  You know we are always
on an hour's notice.  Pretty short, isn't it?
You see we don't want the Germans to get
away with anything if we can help it.  Got
to be ready to sail right down and smash them.
Nobody knows just why the time changes
come.  Somebody knows something of course.
Perhaps one of the British submarines on
outpost duty off the German coast has seen
something, and sent it along by wireless.
</p>

<p>
I asked about the German watch on the
British bases.
</p>

<p>
"Subs.  Everybody's doing it.  I suppose
that two or three are hanging off this coast
all the time trying to get a squint at the
fleet.  It's what we call keeping a 'periscope
watch' ... run by the naval intelligence.
Little good anything they pick up about us
does the Germans!  Safety first is their daring
game.  What they are itching to do is to
pick off one of our patrol squadrons that's
gone on a little prospecting toot all by itself.
They'd try, I think, if they weren't mighty
well aware that not a single ship of the crowd
that did the stunt would ever get back to
the old home canal."
</p>

<p>
Presently a sailor messenger arrived, stood
to attention, saluted snappily, and presented
a paper.  The officer read and signed.
</p>

<p>
"You're in luck," said he.  "We are going
out ... due to leave in three hours.  Whole
fleet together, evidently.  Something's on
for sure....  Hope they're out."  And off
he hurried to his quarters.  I saw "the
exec." going from place to place taking a
look at everything.  Pretty soon the chaplain
of the flagship, an officer to whose friendly
welcome and thoughtful courtesy I am in
real debt, came looking for me.
</p>

<p>
"Come along," he cried, "you are missing
the show.  They're beginning to go out
already.  You ought to be on deck," and seizing
me by the arm, he rushed me energetically
up a companionway to the world without.
There I learned that the departure of the
Grand Fleet was no simultaneous movement
such as the start of an automobile convoy,
but a kind of tremendous process occupying
several hours.  The scout vessels, were to go
first, then the various classes of cruisers and
the destroyer flotillas with whom they acted
in concert, last of all the squadrons of
battleships.  Our own sailing time was three hours
distant and the outward movement had
already begun.

Even a super-dreadnought is wet at times
</p>

<p>
The day was a pleasant one, the sun was
shining clear and a fresh salty breeze was
blowing down the estuary.  The officers,
however, shook their heads, talked of "low
visibility," and pointed out that an invisible
mist hung over the water, whose cumulative
effect was not at all to their liking.
First there went out a new variety of
submarine, steam submarines of extraordinary
size and speed; there followed a swift
procession of destroyers and lighter cruisers,
many signalling with blinker and flag.  The
outgoing of the destroyers was a sight not
to be forgotten, for more than anything else
did it impress upon me the titanic character
of the fleet.  <i>Destroyers passed one every fifty
seconds for a space of many hours</i>.  You would
hear a hiss, and a lean, low rapier of a vessel
would pass within a hundred yards of the
flagship and hurry on, rolling, into the waiting
haze of the open sea, and as you watched this
first vessel leave your bow astern, you would
hear another watery hiss prophetic of the
following boat.  On our own vessel all boats
had long before been hoisted to their places;
there were mysterious crashing noises, bugle
calls, a deal of orderly action.  Time passed;
a long time full of movement and stir.  The
greater vessels began to go out, titans of
heroic name, <i>The Iron Duke</i>, <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>,
<i>Lion</i>.  A broad swirling road of water lay
behind them as one by one they melted
into that ever mysterious obscurity ahead.
Then with a jar, and a torrent of crashing
iron thunder dreadful as a disintegration of
the universe itself, our own immense anchor
chains rose from the water below, and the
American flagship got under way.  We looked
with a meditative eye on the bare shores of
the firth wondering what adventures we were
to have before we saw them again.  Behind
us the mist gathered, ahead, it melted away.
And thus we stood out to the open sea.
Night came, starlit and cold.  Just at
sun-down one of the British ships destroyed a
floating mine with gun fire.  I sought
information from an officer friend.
</p>

<p>
"What about the mine problem?"
</p>

<p>
"Never bothers us a bit, though the
Germans have planted mines everywhere.
This North Sea is as full of them as a pudding
is of plums."
</p>

<p>
"Why is it then that the fleet doesn't
lose ships when out on these expeditions?"
</p>

<p>
"Because the British mine sweepers have
done so bully a job."
</p>

<p>
"But once you get beyond the swept
channels at the harbour mouths, what then?"
</p>

<p>
"The mine-sweepers attend to the whole
North Sea."
</p>

<p>
"You mean to say that the Admiralty
actually clears an ocean of mines?"
</p>

<p>
"To all intents and purposes, yes.  Haven't
you read of naval skirmishes in the North
Sea?  They are always having them.  Many
of those skirmishes take place between patrol
boats of ours and enemy patrols.  Of course
it's a task, but the British have done it.
One of the most wonderful achievements of
the war."
</p>

<p>
"Suppose the Germans try to reach the
British coast?"
</p>

<p>
"They do their best to find the British path.
As a result, the Germans are always either
bumping into their own mines or into ours.
I feel pretty sure that their loss from mines
has been quite heavy."
</p>

<p>
"Where, then, are the German cruising
grounds?  Doesn't their fleet get out once in
a while?"
</p>

<p>
"Not to the outer sea.  Once in a while
they parade up the Danish coast, never going
more than two or three hours from their
base.  Our steady game, of course, is to nab
them when they are out, and cut off their
retreat.  If the weather had held good at
Jutland, this would have been done.  But
the Germans now hardly ever venture out.
Destroyers of theirs, based on the Belgian
coast, try to mix things up in the Channel
once or twice a year, but the fleet seems to
stick pretty closely to dear old Kiel."
</p>

<p>
"Any more information in regard to this
present trip?"
</p>

<p>
"Not a thing.  It's always mysterious like
this.  Yet in twenty minutes we may be right
in the thick of the world's greatest naval
battle."
</p>

<p>
The next morning I rose at dawn to see the
fleet emerge from the dark of night.  A North
Sea morning was at hand, cold, windy and
clear.  Now seas have their characters even
as various areas of land, and there is as much
difference between the North Sea and the
Irish Sea as there is between a rocky New
England pasture and a stretch of prairie.
The shallow North Sea is in colour an honest
salty, ocean green, and its surface is ever in
motion; a sea without respite or rest.  It has
a franker, more masculine character than the
beleaguered sea to the west with its mottlings
of shadow and shoal and weaving, white-crested
tide rips.  A great armament, scouts,
destroyers, and light cruisers had already
passed over the edge of the world, and only
a very thin haze revealed their presence.
Miles ahead of us in a great lateral line, a
number of great warships, vast triangular
bulks, ploughed along side by side, then came
the American squadron in a perpendicular line,
each vessel escorted by destroyers.  Behind
us, immense, stately, formidable and dark,
the second American ship followed down the
broad river of our wake which flowed like
liquid marble from the beat of the propellers.
And behind the American squadron lay other
ships, and over the horizon the bows of more
ships still were pointing to the mine-strewn
German coast.  The Grand Fleet line, <i>eighty
miles long</i>, rode the sea, a symbol of power,
an august and visible defiance.  Standing
beneath the forward turret, beside the muzzles
of the titan guns, I felt that I had at last
beheld the mightiest element of the war.
</p>

<p>
Tightly wrapped in a navy great coat, the
young officer whose guest I had been at
turret drill walked up and down the deck
watching the southeastern horizon.  What
eagerness lay in his eyes!  If we only might
then have heard a heavy detonation from
over the edge of the dawn-illumined sky! ... All
day long we cried our challenge over the
sealed waters ahead.
</p>

<p>
Were "they" out?  To this day, I do not
know.  The ways of the fleet are mysterious.
Certainly, none came forth to accept our
gage of battle.  A time passed, and we were
in port again.  We saw the vessels we had
left behind, the supply ships, tugs, oil tenders,
colliers ... all the servants of the fleet.
</p>

<p>
Down in the wardroom, the tension relaxed.
The anchor chain rattled out; once more
the universe seemed to part asunder.  The
mail had arrived, joyous event.  Somebody
put a roll of music into a rather passé player
piano, and let loose an avalanche of horribly
orderly chords.
</p>

<p>
And all the time the Olympians were preparing,
not the battle of the ages, but the
Great Surrender!

<br /><br />
"SKY PILOTS"
</h3>

<p>
We know him as chaplain, the gobs
use the good old term "Sky Pilot,"
and the British call him "Padre."  His
task, no light one, is to look after the
spiritual and moral welfare of some thousand
sailor souls.  He is general counsellor, friend
in need, mender of broken hearts, counsel
for the defence, censor, and show manager.
Now he comes to the defence of seaman, first
class, Billy Jones, whose frail bark of life has
come to grief on the treacherous reef of the
installment plan, and for whose misdemeanours
a clamouring merchant is on deck threatening
to "attach the ship."  Now he is assuring the
clergyman of the church on the hill that 2nd
class petty officer Edgar K. Lee (who is going
to marry pretty little Norah Desmond) is
not, as far as he knows, committing bigamy.
They tell of a chaplain of the destroyer force
who, pestered beyond bearing by these
demands that the American bridegroom be
declared officially and stainlessly single, floored
his tormentor by replying: "I've told you
that as far as we know the man's unmarried.
We can't give you any assurance more official.
He may be bigamous, trigamous, quadrugamous,
or," here he paused for effect, "pentagamous,
but I advise you to risk it."  The land
sky pilot is said to have collapsed.
</p>

<p>
Aboard the flagship of the Grand Fleet,
the chaplain of the vessel was my guide,
counsellor, and friend.  In the words of one of the
sailors, "Our chaplain is a real feller."  And
indeed it would have been hard to find a
better man for the task than this padre of ours
with his young man's idealism, friendliness,
and energy.  In addition to his welfare work,
he had his duties as a de-coder, and his spare
time he spent tutoring several of the enlisted
personnel who were about to take examinations
for higher ratings.  It is a great mistake,
by the way, to imagine that a violent gulf
lies between the commissioned officer and the
enlisted man.  One finds the higher officer
only too glad to help the sailor advance, and
many times have they said to me, "Don't
write about us, write about the sailors;
get to know them; get their story."  On this
particular ship many of the younger officers
were, like the chaplain, giving up their spare
time to help the ambitious men along.
Correspondence school courses are great favourites
in the Navy, and have undoubtedly helped
many a sailor on to a responsible rating.
</p>

<p>
Our flagship chaplain used to make several
rounds of the ship every day, "tours of
welfare inspection," he used to call them
humorously.  Everywhere would he go, from
wardroom to torpedo station, not neglecting an
occasional visit to the boiler room.  Friendly
grins used to salute him on his passage; as
the sailor said he was a "real feller."  I often
accompanied him on his rounds.  When the
tour was over, we would go to the chaplain's
room for a quiet smoke and a good talk.
The chaplain's room was always clean and
quiet, and on the bookshelf, instead of weighty
books on thermodynamics and navigation,
were the pleasant kind of books one found in
friendly houses over home.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know," said the chaplain to me
one day, "you have landed here at an interesting
time.  There's very little shore leave
being given because it can't be given, and as
a result the life of the ship is thrown back
upon itself for all its amusements and social
activities.  What do you think of the morale
here?"
</p>

<p>
"I think it's very high," I answered.
"The men seem very contented and keen.
I've talked with a great many of them.  How
do you keep the morale up?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, this ship has always been famous
as a 'happy ship'" (here I ventured to say
that any other condition would be impossible
under the captain we had) "and when men
get into the habit of working together
good-naturedly, that habit is liable to stick.  And
I find the men sustained by the thought of
active service.  You may think it calm here,
having just arrived from a destroyer base,
but think of what it is over on the American
coast."
</p>

<p>
"Calm?" said I.  "Don't put that down to
me.  The very idea of being with the Grand
Fleet is thrilling.  It's the experience of a
lifetime.  And let me tell you right from
personal experience that no sight of the land
war can match the impressiveness and
grandeur of the first view of the fleet."
</p>

<p>
"I feel just as you do.  The whole thing is a
constant wonder.  And some day the Germans
may come out.  Moreover, summer is now
at hand, and we shall have a chance to use
the deck more for sports.  This long, raw,
rainy winter doesn't permit much outdoor
exercise.  As soon as it gets warm, however,
we shall have boxing matches on the deck
between various members of the crew and the
champions of the different ships.  We have
some good wrestlers, too.  At present we are
reduced to vaudeville competitions between
our various vessels, and movies.  I'm doing
my best to get better movies.  So we shan't
fare badly after all."
</p>

<p>
"When do you hold Sunday services?"
</p>

<p>
"I have a service in the morning and
another in the evening.  Yes, I muster a pretty
big congregation.  But I'm afraid I've got
to be going now, got to ram a little algebra
into the head of one of the boys.  See you
at dinner."  And our sky pilot was gone.
May good luck go with him, and good friends
be ever at hand to return him the friendliness
he grants.
</p>

<p>
They tell a story of a favourite chaplain
who retired from the Navy to take charge
of a parish on land.
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye, sir," said one of the old salts
to him, as he was leaving the ship.  "Good-bye,
sir.  We'll all look to see you come back with
a <i>bishop's rating</i>."

<br /><br />
IN THE WIRELESS ROOM
</h3>

<p>
I haven't the slightest idea where the
wireless room is or how to find it.  All
that I remember is that some kind soul
took me by the hand, led me through various
passages and down several ladders, and landed
me in a small compartment which I felt sure
must have been hollowed out of the keel.
The wireless room of a great ship is, by the
way, a kind of holy of holies, and my visit to
it more than an ordinary privilege.
</p>

<p>
There are as many messages in the air
these times as there were wasps in the orchard
in boyhood days after one had thrown a large,
carefully-selected stone into the big nest.
Messages in all keys and tunes, messages in
all the known languages, messages in the
most baffling of codes.  Now the operator
picks up a merchantman asking for advice in
English, this against all rules and regulations;
a request once answered by a profane
somebody with "Use the code, you damned fool."  At
intervals the Eiffel Tower signals the time;
listening to it, one seems to hear the clear,
monotonous tick-tock of a giant pendulum.
Now it is a British land station talking to a
British squadron on watch in the North Sea,
now the destroyers are at it, now one hears
the great station at Wilhelmshaven sending
out instructions to the submarine fleet in
ambush off these isles.
</p>

<p>
How strange it is to come here at midnight
and hear the Germans talking!  Germany
has been so successfully cut off from contact
with the civilization she assaulted that these
communications have the air of being messages
from Mars.  There are times when the radio
operator picks up frantic cries sent by one
U-boat to another; I have before me as I
write a record of such a call.  It began at 2.14
A.M., shortly after a certain submarine was
depth-bombed by an American destroyer.
First to be received was <i>OLN's</i> clear, insistent
call for <i>RXK</i> and <i>ZZN</i>, probably the two
nearest members of the U-boat fleet.  Were
they cries for help?  Probably.  Again and
again the spark uttered its despairing message.
For some time there was no answer.  The
other two boats may have been submerged;
quite possibly sunk.  Then at 2.40 from
far, far away came <i>ADL</i> calling <i>OLN</i>.  At
2.45 <i>OLN</i> answered very faintly.  A minute
or two later, <i>ADL</i> tried and tried again to
get either <i>RXK</i> and <i>ZZN</i>.  But there was no
answer.  Was she trying to send them to the
help of the stricken vessel?  At 2.57 <i>ADL</i>
tries for the hard pressed <i>OLN</i>, but no answer
comes to her across the darkness of the sea.
</p>

<p>
Night and day, a force of operators sit here
taking down the messages, sending important
ones directly to the chief officers, and letting
unimportant ones accumulate in batches of
four and five.  The messages are written or
typewritten on a form in shape and make-up
not unlike that of an ordinary telegram blank.
All day and all night long, the messengers
hurry through the corridors of the great ship
with bundles of these naval signals.  And
since everything intended for the Navy comes
in code, decoders too must be at hand at all
hours to unravel the messages.  It is no easy
task, for the codes are changed for safety's
sake every little while.  On board the great
ship I visited, the chaplain did a big share of
this work.  I can see him now bent over his
table in the wireless room, spelling out
sentences far more complicated than the Latin
and Greek of his university days.
</p>

<p>
There is one wireless service which will not
be remembered with affection by our sailors
over there, the Government Wireless Press
Service.  I was in the Grand Fleet when that
dashing business of the first Zeebrugge raid
occurred.  The "Press News" on the
following morning mentioned it, and warned us
impressively to keep our knowledge to
ourselves.  As a result we spoke of it at
breakfast time with bated breath.  I myself, a
modest person, was stricken with a sudden
access of importance at possessing a Grand
Fleet secret.
</p>

<p>
Then at ten o'clock the morning papers
came down from a certain great city with
a full, detailed account of the raid!
</p>

<p>
The thing that we have most against it,
however, is its conduct during the great
offensive of the spring of 1918.  The air was
resounding with the wireless pæans of the
on-rushing Germans; and everybody was
worried, and anxious to know the fortunes
of our troops.  One rushed to breakfast early
to have first chance at the press news.  Friends
gathered behind one's shoulder, and tried
to read before sitting down.  What's the news?
What's the news?  This (or something very
like it) was the news:
</p>

<p>
"Dr. Ostropantski, president of the Græco-Lettish
Diet, denounced yesterday at a meeting
of the Novoe Vremya the German assault
on the liberties of Beluchistan."
</p>

<p>
There was one vast, concerted groan from
the sons of the Grand Fleet.  Some wondered
what the anxious folk far out at sea on the
destroyers were saying.  Finally the wit of
the table shook his head gravely.
</p>

<p>
"Boys," said he, "where <i>would</i> we be if
the civilians refused to tell?"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

XXVI
<br /><br />
MARINES
</h3>

<p>
This paper does not deal with the
marines fighting in France, but with
the marines such as one finds them
on the greater ships.  The gallant "devil
dogs" now adding fresh laurels to the corps
have army correspondents to tell of them,
for though they are trained by the Navy and
are the Navy's men, the Army has them now
under its command.  It is rather of the
genuine marine, the true "soldier of the sea" that
I would speak.  Having been myself something
of a soldier and a sailor, the marines
were good enough to receive me in a friendly
fashion when I was a guest on one of the
battleships now on foreign service.
</p>

<p>
Even as the traditional nickname for the
sailor is "gob," so is "leatherneck" the
seaman's traditional word for the marine.  I
am guileless enough not to know just how
marines take this term, but if there is any
doubt, I advise readers to be easy with it,
for marines will fight at the drop of a hat.
All those aboard declared, by the way, that
the antipathy between the sailor and the
marine in which the public believes, does not
exist, nor do the marines according to the
popular notion "police the ship."  The marine
has his place; the sailor has his, and they do
not mix, not because they dislike each other,
but simply because the marine and the sailor
are the products of two widely different
systems of training.  Moreover, the marine is
bound to his own people by an <i>esprit de corps</i>
without equal in the world.  It was very fine
to see each man's anxiety that the corps should
not merely have a good name, but the best
of names.
</p>

<p>
We swopped yarns.  In return for my gory
tales of shelled cities, gas attacks, and air
raids, they gave me gorgeous ... gorgeous
tales of the little wars they have fought in
the Caribbean.  I realized for the first time
just what it meant to Uncle Sam to be Central
America's policeman.  Now, as they spun
their yarns, I could see the low, white buildings
of a Consulate against the luminous West
Indian sky, the boats on the beach, the
marines on patrol; now the sugar plantation
menaced by some political robber-rebel, the
little tents under the trees, the business-like
machine gun.  A harassed American planter
is often the <i>deux ex machina</i> of these tales.
</p>

<p>
We used to talk in a little office aboard
the battleships down by the marines' quarters,
which lie aft.  I believe it was the sergeant's
sanctum sanctorum.  There were marine
posters on the wall, a neat little stack of
the marines' magazines handy by, a few books,
and some filing cabinets.  Just outside were
the marine lockers, each one in the most
perfect order, and a gun breech used for loading
drills.  The sergeant, himself, was a fine,
keen fellow who had been in the corps for some
time.  His men declared themselves, for the
most part, city born and bred.
</p>

<p>
"What happened then?"
</p>

<p>
"Just as soon as they got the message, a
detail was sent into the hills for the defence
of the plantation.  It was a big sugar
plantation.  The American manager was seeing
red he was so peeved, the harvesting season
had come and the help, scared by the insurgents,
were beating it off into the hills.  What's
more, the insurgents had told the manager
that if he didn't pony up with five thousand
dollars by a certain date, they'd burn the
place.  Actually had the nerve..."
</p>

<p>
"In fiction," said I, "a lean, dark, villainous
fellow mounted on a magnificent horse which
he has looted from some fine stable dashes
up to the plantation door, delivers his threat
in an icy tone and gallops back into the bush.
Or else a message wrapped round a stone
crashes through the window onto the family
breakfast table.  Which was it?"
</p>

<p>
I think the marine telling the story wanted
very much to utter: "How do you get that
way?" however, he merely grinned and answered:
</p>

<p>
"Neither.  A big, fat greaser in a dirty,
Palm Beach suit came ambling up one morning
as if somebody had asked him to chow.  This
was his game.  A holdup?  Oh, no!  Only
his men were getting a bit restless under the
neck, about five thousand dollars restless, and
if they didn't get it, there's no telling what
they wouldn't do.  He thought he could
restrain them till Tuesday night, of course
it would be a pretty stiff job to hold them in,
but if something crisp and green hadn't
shown up by Tuesday P.M., those devils
might actually burn the plantation.  Did
you ever hear such a line of bull?  And that's
the honest truth of it, too; none of this stone
in the mashed potatoes guff."
</p>

<p>
"And then," I broke in, "the faithful
servant gallops through the valley to the shore;
a stray bullet knocks off his hat, but he gets
there, and delivers his message to the warship
in the bay.  A bugle blows, the marines rally,
launches take them to the beach; they rush
over the hills, and get to the plantation just
as Devil's-hoof Gomez or Pink-eyed Pedro
has set fire to a corner of the bungalow.
Rifles crack, bugles sound a charge, the
marines rush the Gomez gang who take to
their heels.  Brave hearts put out the fire.
Isn't there always an exquisitely beautiful
señorita to be rescued?  There always is in
the movies.  Now, please don't destroy any
more of my illusions."
</p>

<p>
"The message comes all right, all right,
but I doubt very much if that faithful servant
comes in a hurry.  Down there, if a man goes
by in a hurry, everybody in the village will be
out to look at him....  The major gets
the message, works out his plan of campaign,
and away we go.  Arrived at the plantation,
we pitch camp, establish pickets, and
generally get things ready to give the restless
greasers a hot time.  Sometimes the greasers
try their luck at sniping; other times, they
go away quietly and don't give you a bit of
trouble.  There aren't any beautiful señoritas,
... no broken hearts.  Yes, it's tough
luck."
</p>

<p>
Thus were my illusions dispelled by a
group of Uncle Sam's marines.  They forgot
to tell me that many members of their little
company had been wounded, and seriously
wounded in these West Indian shindies.  The
list of wounds and honours in the records
was an impressive roll.
</p>

<p>
The visitor aboard a warship will see
marines acting as orderlies and corporals of
the guard and manning the secondary batteries.
I attended many of their drills, and
never shall forget the snap and "pep," of the
evolutions.  Nor shall I forget the courtesies
and friendly help of the gallant officer under
whose command these soldiers of the sea
have the good luck to be stationed.
</p>

<p>
N.B. (Very secret), to Huns only.  The
marines man the gun in the "Exec's" office
and the corresponding one in the line officers'
reading room.  If you want to get home to
the old home canal, ... keep away from
their range.

SHIPS OF THE AIR
</h3>

<p>
After I had been to visit several of
the bases, I returned to London, and
called at the Navy headquarters.  A
young officer of the admiral's staff who was
always ready and willing to help the writers
assigned to the Navy in every possible way,
came down to talk with me.  "Had I been
to Base X?  To Base Y?  Had I been to see
the American submarines?  The Naval
Aviation?"  I grasped at the last phrase.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me about it," I said.  "I had no idea
that the sea flyers were over here.  Last fall
the streets of Boston were so thick with boys
of that service that you could hardly move
round.  And now they are on this side.
Where can I find them?"
</p>

<p>
The officer drew me to a large scale map of
the British Isles and the French coast which
hung on the wall, plentifully jabbed with
little flags.  His finger fairly flew from one
dot to another.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said he, "we have a station here,
another station here, another station there,
... there's a station on this point of land;
right about here we're putting up buildings
for a depot but there is nobody at hand yet,
here's a big station...."  I believe that
he could have continued for five minutes.
</p>

<p>
"You seem to have a big affair well in
hand," I suggested, rather surprised.
</p>

<p>
"No," he corrected, "just beginning.  The
department scheme for the naval aviation
service is one of the big things of the war.
It's so big, so comprehensive that people over
there haven't woken up to it yet.  Aren't
you going to Base L next week?  Why don't
you go down the coast a few miles and see the
outfit at Z?  Only don't forget that we've
'just begun to fight.'  Come upstairs and
let me give you a letter."  A few days later
I ran down to see the aviators in their eyrie.
</p>

<p>
The naval station lay in a sheltered cove
hidden away in a green and ragged coast.
Landing at a somewhat tumble-down old
pier, I saw ahead of me a gentle slope descending
to a broad beach of shingle.  Mid-way
along this beach, ending under the water,
was to be seen a wide concrete runway which
I judged to be but newly finished, for empty
barrels of cement and gravel separators stood
nearby.  At the top of the slope, in a great
field behind mossy trees, lay the corrugated
iron dormitories of a vast, deserted camp once
the repose quarters of a famous fighting
regiment.  There was something of the
atmosphere of an abandoned picnic ground to
the place.  Sailor sentries stood at the entrance
of the quiet roads leading to the empty
barracks, and directed me to those in authority.
</p>

<p>
The naval aviation is a new service.  For
a long time the uniform of the cadets was so
unfamiliar that even in their own America the
boys used to be taken for foreign officers.
It was a case of "I say he's an Italian.  No,
dear, I'm <i>sure</i> he's a Belgian."  A not
unnatural mistake, for the uniform has a certain
foreign jauntiness.  In colour, it is almost
an olive green, and consists of a short,
high-collared tunic cut snugly to the figure, shaped
breeches of the riding pattern, and putties to
match.  Add the ensign's solitary stripe and
star on shoulder and sleeve and you have it.
</p>

<p>
I found a group of the flyers in one of the
tin barracks that did duty as a kind of
recreation centre.  The spokesman of the party
was a serious lad from Boston.
</p>

<p>
"Fire away," they yelled good-naturedly
to my announcement that I was going to
bomb with questions.
</p>

<p>
"First of all, about how many of you are
there helping to make it home-like for Fritz
in this amiable spot?"
</p>

<p>
"About fifty of us."
</p>

<p>
"Been here long?"
</p>

<p>
"No, just came.  You see the station is not
really finished yet, but they are hurrying it
along to beat the cars.  Did you spot that
concrete runway as you came up?  A daisy,
isn't it?  Slope just right, and no skimping
on the width.  Well, that's only one of the
runways we're going to have.  Over on the
other side, the plans call for three or four
more."
</p>

<p>
"And what do these sailors do?" I had
noticed a large number of sailors about.
</p>

<p>
"They look after our machines and the
balloons.  You see this is a regular aviation
section just the same as the army has, and the
sailors are trained mechanics, repair men,
clerks and so forth.  They're rather taking
it easy now because the planes have been
somewhat slow in reaching us.  You know
as well as I do the rumpus that's been made
in the States over the air program.  Things are
breezing up mighty fast now, however, and
every supply ship that puts into the harbour
brings some of our equipment.  The Navy's
ready, the camps are being organized, the men
are trained; it's up to the manufacturers to
hustle along our machines.  Please try to
make them realize that when you write."
</p>

<p>
"But, say," put in another, "don't, for the
love of Pete, run away with the idea that we
haven't any equipment.  We've got some
planes and some balloons.  But we want more,
more, more.  Anything to keep the Germans
on the go."
</p>

<p>
"What do you use?" I asked.  "Mostly
balloons," put in a third speaker, a quiet
young Westerner who had thus far not joined
in the conversation.  "Most of us are balloon
observers, though Jos here," he indicated the
Bostonian, "is a sea-plane artist.  He runs
one of the planes."
</p>

<p>
"Come," said I, "tell the thrilling story."
</p>

<p>
"There isn't any story," groaned Jos,
"that's just the trouble.  I've been fooling
round these coasts and out by the harbour
mouth in the hope of spotting a sub till I feel
as if I'd used up all the gasoline in the British
Isles.  Those destroyers have spilled the
beans.  Fritz doesn't dare to come round.
Ever try fishing in a place from which the
fish have been thoroughly scared away?  It's
like that.  Mine laying submarines used to
be round the mouth of the harbour all the time,
now Fritz is never seen or heard from....
The destroyers have spilled the beans.  The
balloon hounds are the whole show here.
Tell him about it, Mac.  You've taken more
trips than any of the others."  The disgruntled
sea planer knocked a bull-dog pipe on his
shoe, and was still.
</p>

<p>
"I can't tell much," drawled Mac, a wiry,
black little Southerner with a wonderful
accent.  "They fill the balloon up here, take
it out to a destroyer or some patrol boat
and tie it on, jes like a can to purp's tail.
Then you go out in the Irish Sea and watch
for subs.  If you observe anything that looks
like a Hun, you simply telephone it down to
the destroyer's deck, and she rushes ahead and
investigates.  Sometimes the observer in the
balloon sees something which can't be seen
from the level of the destroyer's bridge, and
in that case the balloonist practically steers
the vessel, ... so many points to port,
so many to starboard, and so on till you land
them in the suspected area."
</p>

<p>
"What's it like up above there in a balloon?
From the deck of a battleship or a destroyer,
it seems to be a calm matter."
</p>

<p>
"Don't be too sure of that.  I know it
looks calm, calm as a regular up-in-the-air
old feather baid.  And it isn't bad if you have
a decent wind with which the course and speed
of the ship are in some sort of an agreement.
But if the ship's course lies in one direction and
the wind is blowing from another, the balloon
blows all over the place.  When the wind
blows from behind, you float on ahead and
try to pull the ship after you; if the wind is
from ahead, you are dragged along at the
end of a chain like a mean dawg.  There is
always sure to be a party if the ship zigzags.
Now you are pulling towards the bow,
now you are floating serenely to port, now you
are tugging behind, now you are nowhere
in particular and apparently standing on yo'
haid."
</p>

<p>
We went to walk in the grounds.  I was
shown where the balloon shed was to be, the
generators, and a dozen other houses.
Evidently the station was going to be "some
outfit."  Already a big gang of civilian
labourers, electrified by American energy, were
hard at work laying the foundations of a large
structure.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said one of the boys, "this is going
to be a great place.  When it's completed
we shall have regular sea-plane patrols of this
entire coast, and a balloon squadron ready
to coöperate with either the British or the
American destroyer fleets.  Our boys along
the French coast have already made it hot
for some Huns, and believe me, if there are
any subs left, you just bet we want a chance
at 'em?"
</p>

<p>
Such is the spirit that has driven the Germans
from the seas.

THE SAILOR IN LONDON
</h3>

<p>
The convalescent English Tommy in
his sky-blue flannel suit, white shirt,
and orange four-in-hand, the heavier,
tropic-bred Australian with his hat brim
knocked jauntily up to one side, the dark,
grey-eyed Scotch highlander very braw and
bony in his plaited kilt, these be picturesque
figures on the streets of London, but the most
picturesque of all is our own American tar.
Our "gobs" are always so spruce and clean,
and so young, young with their own youth
and the youth of the nation.  Jack ashore is
to be found at the Abbey at almost any hour
of the day, he wanders into the National
Gallery, and stands before Nelson at St. Paul's;
he causes fair hearts to break asunder
at Hampton Court.  Wherever you go in
London, the wonderful wide trousers, and the
good old pancake hat, this last worn cockily
over one eye, are always to be seen in what
nautical writers of the Victorian school call
"the offing."
</p>

<p>
Our boys come in liberty parties of thirty
and forty from the various bases, usually
under the wing of a chief petty officer very
conscious of his responsibility for these wild
sailor souls.  Accommodations are taken either
at a good London hotel with which the
authorities have some arrangement, or the
personnel is distributed among various huts
and hospitable dwellings.  The great rallying
centre is sure to be the Eagle Hut off the
Strand.
</p>

<p>
This famous hut, which every soldier or
sailor who visits London will long remember,
is situated, by a happy coincidence, in modern
London's most New Yorkish area.  It stands,
a huddle of low, inconspicuous buildings,
in just such a raw open space between three
streets as on this side prefigures the building
of a new skyscraper; the great, modern mass
of Australia House lifts its imposing Beaux
Arts façade a little distance above it, whilst
the front of a fashionable hotel rises against
the sky just beyond.  The ragged island, the
sense of open space, the fine high buildings,
... "say, wouldn't you think you were back
in America again?"  Yet only a few hundred
feet down the Strand, old St. Clement Danes
lies like a ship of stone anchored in the
thoroughfare, and Samuel Johnson, LL.D., stands
bareheaded in the sun wondering what has
happened to the world.  The hut within
is simply an agglomeration of big, clean,
rectangular spaces, reading rooms, living rooms,
dormitories, and baths always full of husky,
pink figures, steam and the smell of soap.
Physically, Eagle hut is merely the larger
counterpart of some thousand others.  The wonder
of the place is its atmosphere.  The narrow
threshold might be three thousand miles
in width, for cross it, and you will find
yourself in America.  All the dear, distinctive
national things for which your soul and body
have hungered and thirsted are gathered here.
There is actually an American shoe shining
stand, an American barber chair, and, Heaven
be praised, "good American grub."  It is a
sight to see the long counter thronged with
the eager, hungry bluejackets, to hear the
buzz of lively conversation carried on in the
pervading aroma of fried eggs, favourite dish
or sandwich of apparently every doughboy
and tar.  One's admiration grows for the
Y. workers who keep at the weary grind of
washing floors, picking up stray cigarette
buts, and washing innumerable eggy plates.
I realized to the full what a poor old college
professor who "helped" in a hut on the French
front meant when he had said to me, "life
is just one damned egg after another."  Of
course sometimes the "hen fruit"&mdash;one hears
all kinds of facetious aliases at the Hut&mdash;gives
way to <i>soi disant</i> buckwheat cakes, a dainty,
lately honoured by royal attention.  Should you
stroll about the buildings, you will see sailors
and soldiers reading in good, comfortable chairs;
some playing various games, others sitting
in quiet corners writing letters home.  There
is inevitably a crowd round the information
bureau.  Alas, for the poor human encyclopedia,
he lives a bewildering life.  On the
morning that I called he had been asked to
supply the address of a goat farm by a
quartermaster charged with the buying of a mascot,
and he was just recovering from this when a
sailor from the Grand Fleet demanded a
complete and careful résumé of the British
marriage regulations!  Everybody seems
cheerful and contented; the officials are
attentive and kind; the guests good-natured and
well-behaved.
</p>

<p>
Such is the combination of club, restaurant,
and hotel to which our Jack resorts.  And
there he lives content in his islet of America,
while London roars about him.  During the
week, he wanders, as he says himself, "all
over the place."
</p>

<p>
The good time ends with the Saturday
ball game.  Everybody goes.  Posters announce
it through London in large black type
on yellow paper.  "U.S. Army <i>vs.</i> U.S. Navy."  The
field is most American looking;
the "bleachers" might be those in any great
American town.  The great game, the game
to remember, was played in the presence of
the king.  The day was a good one, though
now and then obscured with clouds; a
strangely mixed audience was at hand,
wounded Tommies, American soldiers speaking in
all the tongues of all the forty-eight states,
a number of American civilians from the
embassy and the London colony, groups of
dignified staff officers from the army and the
navy headquarters, and even a decorous group
of Britons dressed in the formal garments
which are de rigueur in England at any
high-class sporting event.  Then in came the king
walking ahead of his retinue, ... a man of
medium height with a most kind and
chivalrous face.  Our admiral walked beside
him.  The band played, eager eyes looked
down, the king, looking up, smiled, and
won the good-will of every friendly young
heart.  A few minutes later, the noise broke
forth again, "Oh you Army!"  "Oh you
Navy," a hullaballoo that culminated in a
roar, "Play Ball!"
</p>

<p>
The Navy men, wearing uniforms of blue
with red stripes, walked out first, closely
followed by the army in uniforms of
grey-green.  The admiral, towering straight and
tall above his entourage, threw the ball.  A
pandemonium of yells broke forth.  "Now's
the time, give it to 'em, boys, soak it to 'em,
soak it to 'em, steady Army, give him a can,
run Smithie!"  In a corner by themselves, a
group of bluejackets made a fearful noise
with some kind of whirligig rattles.  Songs
rose in spots from the audience, collided with
other songs, and melted away in indistinguishable
tunes.  British Tommies looked on
phlegmatically, enjoying it all just the same.
There were stray, mocking cat calls.  It was
a real effort to bring one's self back to London,
old London of decorous cricket, tea, and white
flannels.
</p>

<p>
And of course, the Navy won.  Over the
heads of the vanishing crowd floated,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Give 'em the axe, the axe, the axe,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where?  Where?  Where?<br />
  Right in the neck, the neck, the neck,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There!  There!  There!<br />
  Who gets the axe?<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ARMY<br />

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It ends with a roar.
</p>

<p>
Then there is a celebration, and the next
morning, his holiday over, Jack is rounded
up, and put into a railway carriage.  The
roofs of London die away, and Jack, dozing
over his magazines, sees in a dream the great
grey shapes of the battleships that wait for
him in the endless northern rain.

<br /><br />
THE ARMED GUARD
</h3>

<p>
When the Germans began to sink
our unarmed merchant vessels, and
announced that they intended to
continue that course of action, it was
immediately seen that the only possible military
answer to this infamous policy lay in arming
every ship.  There were obstacles, however,
to this defensive programme.  We were at
the time engaged in what was essentially a
legal controversy with the Germans, a
controversy in which the case of America and
civilization was stated with a clarity, a
sincerity, and a spirit of idealism which perhaps
only the future can justly appreciate.  We
could not afford to weaken our case by
involving in doubt the legal status of the
merchantman.  The enemy, driven brilliantly point
by point from the pseudo-legal defences of
an outrageous campaign, had taken refuge in
quibbling, "the ship was armed," "a gun was
seen," "such vessels must be considered as
war vessels."  We all know the sorry story.
For a while, our hands were tied.  Then came
our declaration of war which left our Navy
free to take protective measures.  The
merchantmen were fitted with guns, and given
crews of Navy gunners.  This service, devoted
to the protection of the merchant ship, was
known as the Armed Guard.
</p>

<p>
It was not long before tanker and tramp,
big merchantman and grimy collier sailed
from our ports fully equipped.  Vessels whose
helplessness before the submarine had been
extreme, the helplessness of a wretched
sparrow gripped in the talons of a hawk, became
fighting units which the submarine encountered
at her peril.  Moreover, finding it no longer
easy to sink ships with gunfire, the submarines
were forced to make greater use of their
torpedoes, and this in turn compelled them to
attempt at frequent intervals the highly
dangerous voyage to the German bases on
the Belgian coast.  Sometimes the gun crews
were British; sometimes American.  The
coöperation between the two Navies was at
once friendly and scientific.
</p>

<p>
The guns with which the vessels were
equipped were of the best, and the gun crews
were recruited from the trained personnel
of the fleet.  One occasionally hears,
aboard the greater vessels, lamentations for
gunners who have been sent on to the Guard.
These crews consisted of some half-dozen men
usually under the command of a chief petty
officer.  A splendid record, theirs.  They
have been in action time and time again
against the Germans, and have destroyed
submarines.  There is many a fine tale in the
records of crews who kept up the battle till the
tilt of their sinking vessel made the firing of
the gun an impossibility.  So far, the gunners
on the merchant ships have come in for the
lion's share of attention.  But there is another
and important side of the Armed Guard service
which has not yet, I believe, been called to
the public notice.  I mean the work of the
signal men of the Guard.
</p>

</p>

<p>
The arming of the merchant ships was the
first defensive measure to be adopted; the
second, the gathering of merchantmen into
escorted groups known as convoys.  Now
a convoy has before it several definite
problems.  If it was to make the most of its chances
of getting through the German ambush, it
must act as a well coördinated naval unit,
obeying orders, answering signals, and
performing designated evolutions in the manner
of a battleship squadron.  For instance,
convoys follow certain zigzag plans, prepared
in advance by naval experts.  Frequently
these schemes are changed at sea.  Now if
all the vessels change from plan X to plan Y
simultaneously, all will go well, but if some
delay, there is certain to be a most dangerous
confusion, perhaps a collision.  It is no easy
task to keep twenty or so boats zigzagging
in convoy formation, and travelling in a
general direction eastward at the same time.
Merchant captains have had to accustom
themselves to these strict orders, no easy
task for some old-fashioned masters; merchant
crews have had to be educated to the
discipline and method of naval crews.  Moreover,
there have been occasional foreign vessels
to deal with, and the problem presented by a
foreign personnel.  In order, therefore, to
assure that communication between the guide
ship of the convoy and its attendant vessels
which is, in the true sense of an abused word,
vital to the success of the expedition, the
Navy placed one of its keenest signalmen on
the vessels which required one.  He was there
to give and to send signals, by flag, by
international flag code, by "blinker" and by
semaphore.  The wireless was used as little
as possible between the various vessels of
the merchant fleet, indeed, practically not
at all.
</p>

<p>
The system of signalling by holding two
flags at various angles is fairly familiar since
a number of organizations began to teach it,
and the semaphore system is the same system
carried into action by two mechanical arms.
The method called "Blinker" has a Morse
alphabet, and is sent by exposing and shutting
off a light, the shorter exposures being the dots,
the longer exposures, the dashes.  Sometimes
"blinker" is sent by the ship's search light,
a number of horizontal shutters attached to
one perpendicular rod serving to open and
close the light aperture.  One used to see
the same scheme on the lower halves of
old-fashioned window blinds.  The international
flag code is perhaps the hardest signal system
to remember.  It requires not only what a
naval friend calls a good "brute" memory,
but also a good visual memory.  Many have
seen the flags, gay pieces of various striped,
patched, chequered, and dotted bunting
reminiscent of a Tokio street fair.  The signalman
must learn the flag alphabet, committing to
memory the colours and their geometric
arrangement; he must also learn the special
signification of each particular letter.  For
instance, one letter of the alphabet stands for
"I wish to communicate"; there are also
numbers to remember, phrases, and sentences.
If a signalman cares to specialize, he can study
certain minor systems, for instance the one in
which a dot and a dash are symbolized by
different coloured lights.  A signalman must have a
good eye, a quick brain, and a good memory.
It is a feat in itself to remember what one has
already received while continuing to receive
a long, perhaps complicated message.  Because
of these intellectual requirements, you
will find among the signalmen some of the
cleverest lads in the Navy.  "Giles" such a
lad, "Idaho," another, and "Pop" was
always "on the job."
</p>

<p>
The Guard has its barracks in a great
American port.  One saw there the men being
sorted out, equipped for their special service,
and assigned to their posts.  A fine lot of
real seafaring youngsters, tanned almost
black.  The Navy looked after them in a
splendid fashion.  Said one of the boys to me,
"If I had only known what a wonderful
place the Navy was, I'd been in it long
ago."  The boys were sent over in the merchant
ships, were cleanly lodged in excellent hotels
once they got to land, and were then sent
back on various liners.  The Armed Guard
was a real seafaring service, and its men
one and all were touched by the romance
and mystery of the sea.  They fell in with
strange old tramps hurried from the East,
they broke bread with strange crews, they
beheld the sea in the sullen wrath it cherishes
beneath the winter skies.  One and all they
have stood by their guns, one and all stood
by their tasks, good, sturdy, American lads,
gentlemen unafraid.

GOING ABOARD
</h3>

<p>
Giles, who had just been sent to the
Armed Guard from the fleet, was
waiting for orders in a room at the
naval barracks.  It was early in the spring,
the sun shone renewed and clear; a hurdy
gurdy sounded far, far away.  The big
room was clean, clean with that hard, orderly
tidiness which marks the habitations of men
under military rule.  A number of sailors,
likewise waiting for their orders, stood about.
There was a genuine sea-going quality in
the tanned, eager young faces.  The conversation
dealt with their journeys, with the ships,
with the men, the life aboard, the furloughs
in London.  "Bunch of Danes ... good
eats ... chucked Bill right out of his bunk
... regular peach ... saw Jeff at the Eagle
Hut..."
</p>

<p>
Presently a bosun entered.  A man somewhere
in the thirties, brisk and athletic.  One
could see him counting the assembled sailors
as he came, the numbers forming on his
soundless lips.  The talk died away.
</p>

<p>
"How many men here?" said the bosun
abruptly.
</p>

<p>
Several of the sailors began counting.
There was much turning round, a deal of
whispered estimations.  Every one appeared
to be looking at everybody else.  Finally a
deep voice from a corner said:
</p>

<p>
"Thirty-five."
</p>

<p>
"Any one down for leave?"
</p>

<p>
Some half dozen members of a gun crew
just home from a long journey, called out
that leave had been given them.
</p>

<p>
"Anybody on sick list?"
</p>

<p>
There was no answer.  In the ensuing
silence, the bosun checked off the answers
on his list.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you all want to go out."
</p>

<p>
"Sure!"
</p>

<p>
"Get in line."  The bosun backed away,
and looked with an official eye at the sturdy
group.
</p>

<p>
"All here, pack up and stand by.  At
eleven o'clock have all your baggage at the
drill office.  I'll send a man up to get the mail."
</p>

<p>
The line broke up, keen for the coming
adventure.  Giles, the signalman, walked at a
brisk pace to his quarters...  You would
have seen a lad of about twenty-two years
of age, between medium height and tall, and
unusually well built.  Some years of wrestling&mdash;he
had won distinction in this sport at
school&mdash;had given him a tremendously powerful
neck and chest, but with all the strength
there was no suggestion of beefiness.  The
friendliest of brown eyes shone in the clean-cut,
handsome head, he had a delightful smile,
always a sign of good breeding.  In habit he
was industrious and persevering, in manner of
life clean and true beyond reproach.  Giles is
an American sailor lad, a <i>real gob</i>, and I have
described him at some length because of this
same reality.  The sooner we get to know our
sailors the better.
</p>

<p>
Back in his quarters, he busied himself with
packing his bag.  Now packing one of those
cylindrical bags is an art in itself.  First of
all, each garment must be folded or rolled
in a certain way, the sleeve in this manner,
the collar in that (it is all patiently taught
at training stations) then the articles
themselves must be placed within the bag in an
orderly arrangement, and last of all, toilet
articles and such gear must be stowed within
convenient reach.  A clean smell of freshly
washed clothes and good, yellow, kitchen soap
rose from the tidy bundles.  In went an extra
suit&mdash;"those trousers are real broadcloth,
don't get 'em nowadays, none of that bum
serge they're trying to wish on you," a packet
of underwear tied and knotted with wonderful
sailor knots, and last of all handkerchiefs,
soap, and other minor impedimenta done up
in blue and red bandanna handkerchiefs.
You simply put the articles on the handkerchiefs
and knot the four corners neatly over
the top.  There you have the sailor.  Only at
sea does one realize to what an extent the
bandanna handkerchief is a boon to mankind.
When the bag was packed, it was a triumph of
industry and skill.  Shouldering it, the sailor
walked to the drill office.  He was early.  A
good substantial luncheon had been prepared.
There were plates of hearty sandwiches.
Just before noon, a fleet of "buses" took
them to the pier.
</p>

<p>
The day was clear but none too warm, and
great buffeting salvos of dust-laden wind
blew across the befouled and busy waters of
the port.  A young, almost boyish ensign
gave each man his final orders, and a kind of
identification slip for their captains.  The
sailors of the Guard, wearing reefers and with
round hats jammed tightly on their heads,
stood backed against a wind that curled the
wide ends of their blue trousers close about
their ankles.  Presently, grimy, hot, and
pouring out coils of brownish, choking smoke,
a big ocean-going tug glided over to the wharf
and took them aboard.  Then bells ran,
the propeller churned, and the tug turned her
corded nose down the bay.  The convoy lay
at anchor at the very mouth of the roads.
A miscellaneous lot of vessels, mostly of
British registration; some new, some very,
very old.  The pick of the group was a fine
large vessel with an outlandish Maori name;
Giles heard later that she had just been
brought over from New Zealand.  The
inevitable grimy-decked tankers and ammoniacal
mule boat completed the lot.  An American
cruiser lay at the very head of the line, men
could be seen moving about on her, and there
was much washing flapping in the wind.  The
tug went from vessel to vessel, landing a
signalman here, a gun crew there.  One by one
the lads clambered aboard to shouts of "See
you later," and "Soak 'em one for me."  Giles
was almost the last man left aboard the
tug.  Presently he darted off busily to a
clean little tramp camouflaged in tones of pink,
grey, and rusty black.  The tug slid alongside
caressingly.  There were more bells; a noise
of churning of water.  Over the side of the
greater vessel leaned a number of the crew,
a casual curiosity in their eyes.  Seafaring
men in dingy jerseys opening at the throat
and showing hairy chests.  A putty-faced
ship's boy watched the show a little to one
side.  Presently an officer of the ship, young,
deep-chested and with a freshly-healed,
puckering, star-shaped wound at the left hand
corner of his mouth, came briskly down the
deck and stood by the head of the ladder.
</p>

<p>
Giles caught up his bag, clambered aboard,
and reported.  The officer brought him to the
captain.  Then when the formalities were over,
the second mate took him in charge, and
assigned the lad his quarters and his watches.
</p>

<p>
The convoy set sail the next morning just
as a pale, cold, and unutterably laggard dawn
rose over a sea stretching, vast and empty,
to the clearly marked line of a distant and
leaden horizon.  The escorting cruiser, flying
a number of flags, was the first to get under
way; and behind her followed the merchantmen
in their allotted positions, each ship
flying its position flag.
</p>

<p>
Giles watched the departure from the
bridge.  Behind him the vast city rose silent
above the harbour mist; ahead, rich in promise
of adventure and romance, lay the great plain
of the dark, the inhospitable, the unsullied, the
heroic sea.

<br /><br />
GRAIN
</h3>

<p>
This is "Idaho's" story.  He told it to
me when I met him coming home early
this summer.  We were crossing in a
worthy old transatlantic which has since gone
to the bottom, and Idaho, at his ease in the
deserted smoking room, unfolded the
adventure.  "Idaho, U.S.N.," we called him that
aboard, is a very real personage.  I think he
told me that he was eighteen years old,
medium height, solidly built, wholesome looking.
The leading characteristic of the young,
open countenance is intelligence, an
intelligence that has grown of itself behind those
clear grey eyes, not a power that has grown
from premature contact with the world.
Until he joined the Navy, I imagine that
Idaho knew little of the world beyond his own
magnificent West.  I consider him very well
educated; he declares that preferring life on
his father's ranch to knowledge, he cut high
school after the second year.  He is a great
reader, and likes good, stirring poetry.  He is
an idealist, and stands by his ideals with a
fervour which only youth possesses.  And I
ought to add that Idaho, in the words of one
of his friends, is "one first-class signalman."  This
is Idaho's story, pieced together from his
own recital, and from a handful of his letters.
</p>

<p>
The crowd aboard the naval tug was so
festive that morning, and there was such a
lot of scuffling, punching, imitation boxing
and jollying generally that Idaho did not see
the vessel to which he had been assigned till
the tug was close alongside.  Then, hearing
his name called out, the lad caught up his
baggage, and walked on into the open side of
a vast, disreputable tramp.  The lad later
learned that she had been brought from
somewhere in the China Sea.  The <i>Sebastopol</i>,
Heaven knows where she originally got the
name, was a ship that had served her term
in the west, had grown old and out of date,
and then been purchased by some Oriental
firm.  Out there, she had carried on, always
seaworthy in an old-fashioned way, always
excessively dirty, always a day over due.
When the submarine had made ships worth
their weight in silver, the <i>Sebastopol</i> must have
been almost on the point of giving up the
ghost.  Presently, the war brought the old
ship back to England again.  Her return to
an English harbour must have resembled the
return of a disreputable relative to an anxious
family.  And in England, in some tremendously
busy shipyard, they had patched her
up, added a modern electrical equipment and
even gone to the length of new boilers.  But
her engines they had merely tuned up, and
as for her ancient hull, that they had
dedicated to the mercy of the gods of the sea.
</p>

<p>
Once aboard, and assigned to his station
and watches, the lad had leisure to look over
his companions.  The <i>Sebastopol</i> carried a
crew from Liverpool, and was officered by
three Englishmen and a little Welsh third
mate.  The Captain, a first mate of many
years' experience, to whom the war had given
the chance of a ship, was in the forties; tall
and with a thin, stern mouth under a heavy
brown moustache; the first mate was a mere
youngster: the second, a middle-aged volunteer,
the third, an undersized, excitable Celt
with grey eyes and coal black hair touched
with snow white above the ears.  The
Welshman took a liking for Idaho; used to
question him in regard to the West, being
especially keen to know about "opportunities
there after the war."  He had a brother in
Wales whom he thought might share in a farming
venture.  Of the captain the lad saw very
little; and the first mate was somewhat on
his dignity.  Practically every man of the
crew had been torpedoed at least once, many
had been injured, and had scars to exhibit.
All had picturesque tales to tell, the
gruesomest ones being the favourites.  The best
narrator was a fireman from London, a man
of thirty with a lean chest and grotesquely
strong arms; he would sit on the edge of a
bunk or a chair and tell of sudden thundering
crashes, of the roaring of steam, of bodies
lying on the deck over which one tripped as
one ran, of water pouring into engine rooms,
and of boilers suddenly vomiting masses of
white hot coal upon dazed and scalded stokers.
It was the melodrama of below the water
line.  Then for days the narrator would keep
silent, troubled by a pain in one of his
fragmentary teeth.  All the men kept their few
belongings tied in a bundle, ready to seize the
instant trouble was at hand.  The cook
complained to Idaho that he had lost a gold
watch when the <i>Lady Esther</i> was torpedoed
off the coast of France, and advised him
paternally to keep his things handy.  One of the
oilers, a good-natured fellow of twenty-eight
or nine, had been a soldier, having been
invalided out of the service because of wounds
received late in the summer on the Somme.
An interesting lot of men for an American
boy to be tossed with, particularly for a lad
as intelligent and observing as our Idaho.
The boy was pleased with his job and worked
well.  He did not have very much to do.
Signalling aboard a convoyed ship, though a
frequent business, is not an incessant one.  He
knew that his work would come at the
entrance to the zone.  Sometimes he picked
up messages intended for others.  "<i>Mt. Ida</i>,
you are out of line," "<i>Vulcanian</i>, keep
strictly to the prescribed zigzag plan."  Now
he would see the <i>Sicilian</i> asking for advice;
now there would be a kind of telegraphic
tiff between two of the vessels of the "Keep
further away, hang you" order.  Twenty
ships running without lights through the
ambush of the sea, twenty ships, twenty pledges
of life, satisfied hunger ... victory.  In other
days, one's world at sea was one's ship; a
convoy is a kind of solar system of solitary
worlds.  Hour after hour, the assembled ships
straggled across the great loneliness of the sea.
</p>

<p>
The crew had a grievance.  It was not
against their officers, but against his majesty's
government, against "a bloody lot of top
hats."  A recent regulation had forbidden
sailors to import food into the United
Kingdom, and all the dreams of stocking up "the
missus'" larder with American abundance had
come to naught.  Idaho says that there was
an engineer who was particularly fierce.
"Don't we risk our lives, I arsk yer," he would
say, "bringing stuff to fill their ruddy guts,
and now they won't even let us bring in a bit
of sugar for ourselves."  The rest of the crew
would take up the angry refrain; a mention
of the food regulations was enough to set the
entire crew "grousing" for hours.
</p>

<p>
And then came trouble, real trouble.
</p>

<p>
On the fifth day out Idaho, called for his
early watch, found the boat wallowing in a
heavy sea.  The wind was not particularly
heavy, but it blew steadily from one point
of the compass, and the seas were running
dark, wind-flecked, and high.  The <i>Sebastopol</i>,
accustomed to the calm of eastern seas, was
pitching and rolling heavily.  Presently the
cargo began to shift.  Now, to have the cargo
shift is about the most dangerous thing that
can happen to a vessel.  One never can tell
just when the centre of gravity of the mass will
be displaced, and when that contingency
occurs, the big iron ship will roll over as
casually and as easily as a dog before the fire.  It
takes courage, plenty of courage, to keep such
a ship running, especially if you are down by
the boilers or in the engine room.  You have
to be prepared to find yourself lying in a
corner somewhere looking up at a ceiling which,
strange to say, has a door in it.  The <i>Sebastopol</i>
leaned away from the wind like a stricken
man crouching before a pitiless enemy; the
angle of her smokestack more than anything
else betraying the alarming list.  In her
stricken condition, the ship seemed to become
more than ever personal and human.
Presently her old plates bulged somewhere and
she began to leak.
</p>

<p>
The vessel carried a cargo of grain, in these
days more than ever a cargo epical and symbolic;
a holdful of rich grain, grain engendered
out of fields vast as the sea, bred by the
fruitful fire of the sun, rippled by the passing of
winds from the mysterious hills, grain, symbolic
of satisfied hunger, ... victory.  A cargo
of grain, life to those on land, to those on
board, danger and the possibility of a violent
if romantic death.  The crew, too occupied
with the emergency to curse the stevedores,
ran hither and thither on swift, obscure
errands.  And the weather grew steadily worse,
the leak increasing with the advance of the
storm.  Down below, meanwhile, a force of
men hardly able to keep their balance,
buffeted here and there by the motion of the
ship, and working in an atmosphere of choking
dust, transferred a number of bags from one
side to another.  Unhappily, the real mischief
was due to grain in bins, and with this store
little could be done.  And always the water
in the hold increased in depth.
</p>

<p>
The pumps, orders had been given to
start them directly the leak was noticed.
Three minutes later, the machinery and the
pipes, fouled with grain, refused to work.
They saw bubbles, steam, a trickle of water
that presently stopped, and lumps of wet grain
that some one might have chewed together,
and spat forth again.  Idaho did a lot of
signalling in code to the guide ship of the convoy.
The <i>Sebastopol</i> began to drop behind.  An order
being given to sleep up on the boat deck so
as to be ready to leave at any instant, the
men dragged their bedding to whatever shelter
they could find.  The captain appeared never
to take any time off for sleep.  Day after day,
through heavy seas, under a sky torn and
dirty as a rag, the old <i>Sebastopol</i> listing badly
and sodden as cold porridge, carried her
precious cargo to the waiting and hungry east.
Giving up all hope of keeping up with her
sisters, she fell behind, now straggling ten,
now fifteen miles astern.  At length the
weather changed; the sea became smooth,
blue and sparkling, the sky radiant and clear.
</p>

<p>
Then the destroyers came.  There was a
parley, and the other vessels of the convoy
zigzagged wildly for a while in order to allow
the <i>Sebastopol</i> to catch up.  But in spite of all
attempts, the old ship fell behind again and
was suffered to do so, lest the others,
compelled to adopt her slow speed, be seriously
handicapped in their race down the gauntlet.
Then it was discovered that the leak had
gained alarmingly; there was even talk of
abandoning the vessel and taking to the boats.
A try was made to pump out the boat with
an ancient hand engine.  The contrivance
clogged almost at once.  According to Idaho,
it was much like trying to pump out a thick
bran mash such as they give sick calves.
And they were only two days from land.
Barely afloat, just crawling, and with the
submarine zone ahead of them....  But the gods
were kind, and the old boat and the solitary
destroyer went down the Channel and across
the Irish Sea as safely as clockwork toys
across a garden pool.  Yet they passed quite
a tidy lot of wreckage.  Nearer ... nearer
all the time, till late one afternoon two big
tugs raced to meet them at the mouth of a
giant estuary.  The <i>Sebastopol</i> was at the
end of her tether.  Another day, and it would
have been a case of taking to the boats.
</p>

<p>
The tugs hurried her into a waiting dry
dock.
</p>

<p>
Idaho, his papers signed, his bag upon his
shoulder, got into a little tender which was
to take him over to the harbour landing.
Looking up, he saw some of the crew leaning
over the rail....  They grinned with friendly,
soot-streaked faces, waved their arms....
The <i>Sebastopol</i> was safe, the rich cargo of
grain, the life-giving yellow grain was safe....
The tug slid off into the busy, noisy
riverway.
</p>

<p>
And thus came Idaho of the Armed Guard
to the Beleaguered Isles.

COLLISION

"......Regret to report collision in latitude x and
longitude y between tank steamships <i>Tampico</i> and
<i>Peruvian</i>......"&mdash;<i>Extract from an Admiralty paper</i>.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
When supper was over, the two
sailors of the Armed Guard attached
to the ship went out on deck for a
breath of evening air.  It was just after
sundown, a clean calm rested upon the monstrous
plain of the sea; one golden star shone tranquil
and lonely in the west.  The convoy was
almost at the border of the zone.  To the left
the lads could see the twin funnels of the big
grain ship; the tattered, befouled horse boat,
the little, rolling tramp said to be full of
T.N.T., and the long low bulks and squat
houses of the two tanks.
</p>

<p>
"Whoever's on that tramp is some bird at
signals," said the bigger of the boys, my friend
"Pop."  "Generally starts to answer my
signal before I'm through.  Know who's aboard
her, Robbie?"
</p>

<p>
"I think it's that big new guy from the
Pennsylvania" answered Robbie, meditatively.
</p>

<p>
"Dalton's on the horse boat, isn't he?"
</p>

<p>
"Sure, either he or Ricci.  Pete Johnson's
on the first tank, and that fresh little Rogers
guy's on the other."
</p>

<p>
There was a pause.  Pop spat with unction
over the side.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly their vessel entered a fog bank,
passing through a detached island or two of
it before plunging on into the central mass.
The convoy instantly faded from sight.
Every now and then, out of the wall of grey
ahead, a little swirl of fog detached itself, and
floating down the darkening deck, melted into
the opaque obscurity behind.  Drops of
moisture began to gather on the lower surface of
the brass rails of the companion ways; wires
grew slippery to the touch; little worm-like
trails of over-laden drops slid mechanically
down sloping surfaces.  The fog, thickening,
flowed alongside like a vaporous current.
Overhead, however, the sky was fairly clear,
though the greater stars shone aureoled and
pale.  There was very little sound, merely
the steady hissing of the calm water alongside,
occasional voices heard in a tone of
consultation,&mdash;the heavy slam of a door.  An
hour passed.  The fog showed no sign of
lifting, seeming rather to become of denser
substance with the dark.  Pop was glad
that there was no ship following directly
behind, and wondered if the others were
dragging fog buoys.  The ship's bell rang
muffled and morne in the fog.  Suddenly,
out of the clinging darkness, out of the
oppressive obscurity, there came, momentary,
brazen, and incredibly distant a dull and
muffled sound.  So far away and mysterious
was its source that the sound might have been
imagined as coming from the dark beyond
the stars.  An instant later, as if the only
purpose of its mysterious existence had been
to sink a tanker, the fog melted into the
night, and a little wind, a little, timid,
trembling breath brushed the great plume of smoke
from the funnel lightly aside.  A bright
starlit night came into being as if by
enchantment, as if created out of the fog by the
intervention of divine will.
</p>

<p>
The motionless black shapes of the colliding
tankers could be seen far, far astern.
After the crash, they had drifted apart.  The
wireless was crackling, blinker lights flashed
their dots and dashes of violet white, a
whistle blew.  "Am standing by," came a
message.  The chief of the convoy sent out
a peremptory command.  Presently a light
appeared on one of the vessels, a little rosy
glow like a Chinese lantern.  The glow sank,
disappeared, and rose again, having gathered
strength.  One of the tankers was on fire.
Soon a second glow appeared close by its
stern.  A glow of warm, rosy orange.  In a
few minutes they could see tongues of fire,
and two boats rowing away from the vessel.
They did not know that the men in the boats
were rowing for their lives through a pool of
oil which might take fire at any instant.  A
few minutes passed; the light grew brighter.
Suddenly, there was a kind of flaming burst:
a great victory of fire.  The tanker, well
down by the head, floated flaming in an ocean
that was itself a flame, floated black, silent,
and doomed to find an ironic grave in
the waters under the fire.  Great masses of
smoke rose from the burning pool into the
serene sky, and hid the vessel when she sank.
Half an hour later, a little, rosy light lay
at the horizon's rim.  Suddenly, like a lamp
blown out, it died.

<br /><br />
THE RAID BY THE RIVER
</h3>

<p>
The convoy of merchantmen, after a
calm, quite uneventful voyage across
the ambushed sea, put into a port on
the Channel for the night, and the following
morning dispersed to their various harbours.
Some sort of coast patrol boat "not much
bigger than an Admiral's launch," the words
are those of my friend Steve Holzer of the
Armed Guard, took the S.S. <i>Snowdon</i> under
her metaphorical wing, and brought her up
the Thames.  This <i>Snowdon</i> was one of a
fleet of twelve spry little tramps named for
the principal mountains of the kingdom, a
smart, well-equipped, well-ordered product of
the Tyne.  Steve, quick, clever, and alert,
had got along capitally with the "limeys."  His
particular pals were a pair of twin lads
about his own age, young, English, blond, and
grey-eyed; young, slow to understand a joke,
honest, good-tempered, and sincere.  I have
seen the postcard photograph of themselves
which they gave Steve as a parting gift.
Steve himself is a Yankee from the word go,
a genuine Yankee from somewhere along the
coast of Maine.  He stands somewhat below
medium height, is lean-faced and lean-bodied;
his eyes twinkle with a shrewd good humour.
A great lad.  He tells me that his people have
been seafaring folk for generations.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Snowdon</i>, escorted by her tiny guard,
ran down the coast, entered the Thames estuary,
passed the barriers, and finally resigned
herself to the charge of a tug.  Late in the
afternoon, the mass of London began to
enclose them, they became conscious of strange,
somewhat foul, land smells; the soot in the
air irritated their nostrils.  The ship was
docked close after dusk.  The feeling of
satisfaction which seizes on the hearts of
seamen who have successfully brought a ship
into port entered into their bosoms;
everybody was happy, happy in the retrospect of
achievement, in the prospect of peace,
security, good pay, and good times.
</p>

<p>
Their vessel lay in a basin just off a great
bend in the river, in a kind of gigantic concrete
swimming pool bordered with steel arc-light
poles planted in rows like impossibly perfect
trees.  To starboard, through another row
of arc poles and over a wall of concrete, they
could see the dirty majesty of the great brown
river and the square silhouetted bulks of the
tenements and warehouses on the other side.
To port, lay a landing stage some two hundred
feet wide, backed by a huge warehouse over
whose dingy roof two immense chimneys towered
like guardians.  The space stank of horse;
the river had lost the clean smell of the sea,
and breathed a reek of humanity and inland
mire.  A mean cobbled-stone street led from
a corner of the landing space past wretched
tenements, fried fish shops, and pawnbrokers'
windows exhibiting second rate nautical
instruments, concertinas, and fraternal emblems.
It was all surprisingly quiet.
</p>

<p>
Steve, hospitably invited to remain aboard,
went to the starboard rail and stood studying
the river.  The last smoky light had ebbed
from the sky; night, rich and strewn with
autumnal stars, hung over the gigantic city,
and a moon just passing the first quarter hung
close by the meridian, and shone reflected
in the pool-like basin and the river's moving
tide.  One of the huge chimneys suddenly
assumed a great, creamy-curling plume of
smoke which dissolved mysteriously into the
exhalations of the city.  From down in the
crew's quarters came the musical squeals
of a concertina, and occasional voices whose
words could but rarely be distinguished.  The
arc lights by the basin edge suddenly flowered
into a dismal glow of whitish yellow light
strangled by the opaque hoods and under
cups affixed by the anti-aircraft regulations.
Another concertina sounded further down the
street.  The moonlight, like a kind of supernal
benediction, fell on smokestack and funnel,
on shining grey wire and solemn, rusted
anchor, on burnished capstan and finger
smoutched door.  Heat haze, flowing in a
swift and glassy river, shone above the
smokestack in the moon.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, Steve heard down the street
a sustained note from something on the order
of a penny whistle, and an instant later, a
window was flung up, and a figure leaned out.
It was too dark to see whether it was a man
or a woman.  Then the same whistle was
blown again several times as if by a conscientious
boy, and a factory siren with a sobbing
human cry rose over the warehouses.  At
the same moment, the lights about the dock
flickered, clicked, and died.  There was a
confused noise of steps behind, there were
voices&mdash;"Hey, listen!" "Wot's that?" the
last in pure cockney, and a questioning,
doubting Thomas voice said: "A raid?"  The
figure of the captain was seen on the bridge.
One of the ships' boys went hurrying round,
doing something or other, probably closing
doors.  The twins strolled over to Steve, and
informed him in the most casual manner that
they were in for a raid.  It was Steve's first
introduction to British unemotionalism, and
I imagine that it rather let him down.  He
says that he himself was "right up on his
tiptoes."  He also had a notion that bombs
would begin to rain from the sky directly
after the warning.  The twins soon made it
clear, however, that the warning was given
when the raiders were picked up on the east
coast, and that there was generally some
twenty minutes or half an hour to wait before
"the show" began.  Every once in a while,
somebody in the group would steal a look
at the pale worlds beyond the serried chimney
pots and at the moon, guiltless accomplice
of the violence and imbecilities of men.
</p>

<p>
Presently, a number of star shells burst
in fountains of coppery bronze.  Every hatch
covered, every port and window sealed, the
<i>Snowdon</i> awaited the coming of the raiders.
Whistles continued to be heard, faint and far
away.  From no word, tone, or gesture of
that English crew could one have gathered
that they were in the most dangerous quarter
of the city.  For the one indispensable element
of a London raid is the attack on the waterfront,
the attack on the ships, the ships of
wood, the ships of steel, the hollow ships
through which imperial Britain lives.
</p>

<p>
There is little to be seen in a London raid
unless you happen to be close by something
struck by a bomb.  The affair is almost
entirely a strange and terrible movement of
sound, a rising, catastrophic tide of sound,
a flood of thundering tumult, a slow and sullen
ebb.
</p>

<p>
"There!  'Ear that?" said some one.
</p>

<p>
Far away, on the edge of the Essex marshes
and the moon-lit sea, a number of anti-aircraft
guns had picked up the raiders.  The air
was full of a faint, sullen murmur, continuous
as the roar of ocean on a distant beach.
Searchlight beams, sweeping swift and mechanical,
appeared over London, the pale rays searching
the black islands between the dimmed
constellations like figures of the blind.  They
descended, rose, glared, met, melted together.
The sullen roaring grew louder and nearer,
no longer a blend, but a sustained crescendo
of pounding sounds and muffled crashes.  A
belated star shell broke, and was reflected
in the river.  A police boat passed swiftly
and noiselessly, a solitary red spark floating
from her funnel as she sped.  The roaring
gathered strength, the guns on the
coast were still; now, one heard the guns
on the inland moors, the guns in the fields
beyond quiet little villages, the guns lower
down the river&mdash;they were following the
river&mdash;now the guns in the outer suburbs,
now the guns in the very London spaces,
ring, crash, tinkle, roar, pound!  The great
city flung her defiance at her enemies.  Steve
became so absorbed in the tumult that he
obeyed the order to take shelter below quite
mechanically.  A new sound came screaming
into their retreat, a horrible kind of whistling
zoom, followed by a heavy pound.  Steve
was told that he had heard a bomb fall.
"Somewhere down the river."  Nearer,
instant by instant, crept the swift, deadly
menace.  A lonely fragment of an anti-aircraft
shell dropped clanging on the steel deck.
</p>

<p>
"You see," explained one of the twins in
the careful passionless tone that he would
have used in giving street directions to a
stranger, "the Huns are on their way up the
river, dropping a kettle on any boat that looks
like a good mark, and trying to set the docks
afire.  The docks always get it.  Listen!"
</p>

<p>
There was a second "zoom," and a third
close on its heels.
</p>

<p>
"Those are probably on the <i>Ætna</i> basins,"
said the other twin.  "Their aim's beastly
rotten as a rule.  If this light were out, we
might be able to see something from a hatchway.
Mr. Millen (the first mate) makes an
awful fuss if he finds any one on deck."  "I
know what's what, let's go to the galley, there's
a window that can't be shut." ... The three
lads stole off.  Beneath a lamp turned down
to a bluish-yellow flame, the older seaman
waited placidly for the end of the raid, and
discussed, sailor fashion, a hundred irrelevant
subjects.  The darkened space grew chokingly
thick with tobacco smoke.  And the truth
of it was that every single sailor in there knew
that the last two bombs had fallen on the
<i>Ætna</i> basins, and that the <i>Snowdon</i> would
be sure to catch it next.  By a trick of
the gods of chance, the vessel happened to
be alone in the basin, and presented a
shining mark.  The lads reached the galley
window.
</p>

<p>
By crowding in, shoulder to shoulder, they
could all see.  The pool and its concrete wall
were hidden; the window opened directly
on the river.  Presently came a lull in the
tumult, and during it, Steve heard a low,
monotonous hum, the song of the raiding
planes.  More fragments of shrapnel fell
upon the deck.  The moon had travelled
westward, and lay, large and golden, well clear
of the town.  The winter stars, bright and
inexorable, had advanced ... the city was
fighting on.  Suddenly, the three boys heard
the ominous aerial whistle, one of the twins
slammed the window to, and an instant
later there was a sound within the dark little
galley as if somebody had touched off an
enormous invisible rocket, ... a frightful
"zoom," and impact ... silence.  They
guessed what had happened.  A bomb intended
for the <i>Snowdon</i> had fallen in the river.
Later somewhere on land was heard a thundering
crash which shook the vessel violently.
A pan or something of the kind hanging on
the galley wall fell with a startling crash.
"Get out of there, you boys," called the cook.
Ship's galleys are sacred places, and are to
be respected even in air raids.  And then
even more slowly and gradually than it
had gathered to a flood, the uproar ebbed.
The firing grew spasmodic, ceased within
the city limits, lingered as a distant
rumble from the outlying fields, and finally
died away altogether.  The sailors, released
by a curt order, came on deck.  The top
of the concrete wall was splashed and mottled
with dark puddles and spatters of water.
All agreed that the bomb had fallen
"bloody close."  The peace of the abyss
rules above.  Far down the river, there was
an unimportant fire.
</p>

<p>
Said Steve&mdash;"I certainly was sore when I
didn't have any excitement on the way over
in the convoy, but after that night in the
<i>Snowdon</i>, I decided that being with the Armed
Guard let you in for some real stuff.  It's
a great service."
</p>

<p>
With which opinion all who know the Guard
will agree.

XXXIV
<br /><br />
ON HAVING BEEN BOTH A SOLDIER AND A SAILOR
</h3>

<p>
When this cruel war is over, and the
mad rounds of parades, banquets and
reunions begin, I shall immediately
set to work to organize the most exclusive
of clubs.  A mocking and envious friend suggests
that our uniform consist of a white sailor
hat, a soldier's tunic, British, French, or
American according to the flags under which
we served, and a pair of sailor trousers with
an extra wide flare.  For the club is to be
composed of those fortunate souls who like myself
have seen "the show" on land and on sea.
To my mind, however, instead of mixing the
uniforms, it would be better to dress in khaki
when we feel military; in blue when our
temperament is nautical.  Think of belonging
to a club whose members can dissect a
trench mortar with ease and at the same time
say: "Three points off the port bow" without
turning a hair.  I should admit marines only
after a special consideration of each case.  Not
that I don't admire the marines.  I do.  I
yield to no one in my admiration of our gallant
"devil dogs."  But the applicant for admission
to our club must have first served as a bona
fide soldier and then as a bona fide sailor or
vice versa.  Not that I am a sailor or ever
was a sailor in Uncle Sam's Navy.  All that
I can claim to have been is a correspondent
attached to the Navy "over there."  But
four months' service, most of it spent at sea
on the destroyers, subs, and battleships
entitles me, I think, to membership,
consequently, being president, I have admitted
myself.
</p>

<p>
"Well, you've seen the war both on land
and on sea; which service do you prefer
... the army or the Navy?"  This question is
hurled at me everywhere I go.  I answer it
with deliberation, enjoying the while to
the full the consciousness of being an
extraordinary person, a sort of literary Æneas,
<i>multum jactatus et terris et alto</i>.  And I answer
briefly:
</p>

<p>
"The Navy."
</p>

<p>
I hasten to add, however, that you will find
my answer coloured by a passion for the
beauty and the mystery of the sea with
which some good spirit endowed me in my
cradle.  I was born in one of the most historic
of New England seacoast towns where brine
was anciently said to flow through the veins
of the inhabitants.  On midsummer days the
fierce heat distils from the cracked, caked
mud of tidal meadows the clean, salty smell
of the unsullied sea; dark ships, trailing far
behind them long, dissolving plumes of smoke,
weave in and out between the tawny, whale-backed
islands of the bay, and tame little sea
birds almost the colour of the shingle run
along at the edge of the in-coming tide.  So
I admit a bias for the service of the sea.
</p>

<p>
Does the Navy demand as much of the sailor
as the Army does of the soldier?  A vexed
question.  The Army, comparing grimly its
own casualty lists with the Navy's occasional
roll sometimes imagines naturally enough
that the sailor lives, as the old hymn has it,
"on flowery beds of ease."  As a whole there
is no denying that living conditions are far
better in the naval service, though much
depends on the boat to which the sailor is
assigned.  A soldier in the trenches sleeps in
his clothes, so does a sailor on a destroyer or
a patrol boat, and I do not believe that I felt
much more comfortable at the end of a long
trip in an old destroyer during which the vessel
rolled, pitched, tossed, careened, stood on
her head, sat on her tail and buckled than I
did after a week or so at the front.  Certainly,
there was little to choose between the
overcrowded living quarters of the sailors and a
decent "dug-out."  True, the "Toto," alias
greyback, alias "Cootie" or his occasional
but less famous accomplice the "crimson
rambler" does not infest a Navy ship.  How
many times have I not heard Army folk say
in heartfelt tones, "Those Navy people can
keep <i>clean</i>."  But a truce to the Cootie.
Much more has been made of him than he
deserves.  During the first six months of the
war the creature was in evidence, but after
the hostilities began to limit themselves to
the trench swathe, and this localizing war
made possible a stable system of hospitals,
cantonments and baths, the Cootie became
as rare as a day in June and to have such guest
was an indication of abysmally bad luck
or personal uncleanliness.  Moreover, a little
gasoline begged from a lorry driver and
sprinkled on one's clothes confers unconditional
immunity.  Consider the crew of a submarine.
They do not have to splash about in a gulley
of smelly mud the consistency of thick soup,
or wander down alleyways of red brown mud,
so cheesy that it sticks to the boots till one
no longer lifts feet from the ground, but
shapeless, heavy, thrice cussed lumps of mire.
No one has yet risen to sing the epic of the
mud of France; yet 'tis the soul of the war.
The submarine sailors are spared the mud,
but they live in a sealed cylinder into which
sunlight does not penetrate, live in the close
atmosphere of a garage; they can not get
exercise or change clothes.  A submarine
crew that has had a hard time of it looks
quite as worn out as soldiers just out of battle
and their colour is far worse.  And if there
is a more heroic service than this submarine
patrol, I should like to know of it.
</p>

<p>
And now the army in me rises to protest.
"I admit," says the military voice, "that
service on ships may be a confounded sight
more disagreeable than I had imagined, but
the sailor has a chance when he gets to port
of changing his uniform, whilst a poor lad
of a soldier must fight, eat, and sleep in the
same old uniform, and must limit his changes
to a change of underclothes."
</p>

<p>
True, oh military spirit.  Civilian, and thou,
too, oh sailor, do you know what it is to be
confined, to be wedded, without jest, "till
death do us part" to <i>one</i> suit.  One faithful,
persistent, necessary uniform and <i>one</i> only.
Two-thirds of the joy of permission is the pleasure
of getting out of a dirty, stale, besweated
uniform.  Heaven bless, Heaven shower a
Niagara of happiness on those kindly ladies
who sent us supplies of socks and jerseys!
Don't be content to knit Johnny socks and
a sweater, keep on knitting him a number of
them, and send them over at intervals.  The
dandies of a section used to leave extra
clothes in villages behind the lines.  Alas,
sometimes, the group, after service "<i>aux
tranchées</i>" was not marched back to the
same village, and it was difficult to get
permission to visit the other village, even were it
near.  Such expedients, however, are for
luxurious times.  Quite often there are no
habitable villages for miles behind the lines, or else
the civilian inhabitants have been ruthlessly
warned away.  In such circumstances there
is no clean cache of clothes to be left behind
in Madame's closet.  But the sailor
... though he returns as grimy as a printers'
devil and as bearded as a comic tramp, there
is always a clean suit of "liberty blues" in
his bag, and to-morrow, clad in the handsomest
of all naval uniforms, he will be found
ashore, breaking fair British or Irish hearts.
</p>

<p>
I have tried to show that in the judgment
of an ex-soldier, the difference between the
life of a sailor in a fighting ship and the life
of a soldier in a fighting regiment is by no
means as great as it has been imagined.
The army, I suppose, will grumble at such
a pronunciamento.  Let an objector, then,
try being a lookout man all winter long on
a destroyer ... or try firing a while.  All is
not quite purgatorial even at the front.  Most
army men know of quiet places along the line
held on our side by rubicund, wine-bibbing,
middle-aged French "territoriaux," <i>bons pères
de famille</i> who show you pictures of Etienne
and Maurice; and garrisoned on the enemy's
border by fat old Huns who want very, very
much to get home to their great pipe and
steaming sauerkraut.  In such places each
side apologizes for the bad taste of their
supporting artillery, whilst grenade throwing
is regarded as the bottom level of viciousness.
Once in a while people die there of old age,
gout, or chronic liver.  No one is ever killed.
Such "ententes cordiales" were far more
frequent than those behind the line have ever
suspected.  On the other hand, some twenty
miles down the trench swathe there may be
a hillock constantly contested, a strategic
point which burns up the lives of men as
casually as the sustaining of a fire consumes
faggots.  Now it is the quick, merciful bullet
in the head, now the hot, whizzing éclat of
a high explosive, now the earthquake of the
subterranean mine.  But after all, a mine
at sea is no more gentle than one on land, and
to have a mine exploded under him is perhaps
the eventuality which a soldier fears more
than anything else.  On land, the thundering
release of a giant breath from out of the earth,
a monstrous pall of fragments of soil, stones,
and dust ... perhaps of fragments more
ghastly, at sea, a thundering pound, a column
of water which seems to stand upright for
a second or two and then falls crashing on
whatever is left of the vessel.  <i>Quelle monde!</i>
</p>

<p>
There is a distinct difference between the
psychology of the soldier and that of the sailor.
A soldier of any army is sure to be drilled, and
drilled, and drilled again till he becomes what
he ought to be, a cog in an immense machine
scientifically designed for the release of
violence; a sailor, drilled scientifically enough
but not so machinally, preserves some of the
ancient freedom of the sea.  Then, too,
the soldier with his bayonet is a fighting force;
the sailor, though prepared for it, himself
rarely fights, but works a fighting mechanism,
... the ship.  The battleship X may sink
the cruiser Y, but there is rarely a "<i>corps a
corps</i>" such as takes place for instance in a
disputed shell crater.  Thus removed from
the baser brutalities of war, the sailor never
reveals that vein of Berserker savagery which
soldiers will often reveal in a conquered
province.  As a class, sailors are the best-natured,
good-hearted souls in the world.  Rough some
may be, some may be scamps, but brutal,
never.  Moreover, living under a discipline
easier to bear than the soldiers, Jack has not
the sullen streaks that overtake betimes men
under arms.  Of course, he grumbles, enlisted
men are not normal if they don't grumble,
but Jack's grumbling is as nothing compared
to the fierce, smothered hate for things in
general which every soldier sometimes feels.
</p>

<p>
I would follow the sea, because I am a
lover of the mystery and beauty of the sea,
and because my comrades would be sailormen.
I would knock at the Navy's door because,
after all is said and done, the naval power is
the ultima ratio of this titanic affair.  I
have seen many of the great scenes of this war,
among them Verdun on the first night of the
historic battle, but nothing that I saw on land
impressed me as did my first view of the
British Grand Fleet in its northern harbour,
... the dark ships, the hollow ships, rulers
of the past, rulers of the future, unconquered
and unconquerable.

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
